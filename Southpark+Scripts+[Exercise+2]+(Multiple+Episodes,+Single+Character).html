 &#34;Shut up, I didn&#39;t pee in my pants!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, you would taste my pee!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey you guys. I know a scary story.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?&#39;,
 &#39;Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills &#39;
 &#39;anybody who dares climb to the top.&#39;,
 &#39;Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its &#39;
 &#39;deformed body.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…&#39;,
 &#39;No! A piece of celery.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And &#39;
 &#34;where his leg should be, there&#39;s nothing but…Patrick Duffy.&#34;,
 &#39;What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on &#39;
 &#39;this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that &#39;
 &#39;on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … &#39;
 &#39;tahink.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, it might be!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys! … Go to Hell!&#39;,
 &#34;They don&#39;t think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let&#39;s see how they like it when &#34;
 &#34;they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I&#39;ll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!&#34;,
 &#39;I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.&#39;,
 &#39;Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.&#39;,
 &#39;Holy crap! &#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is wrong with you people?!&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, wait, aah!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys, it&#39;s just me.&#34;,
 &#39;Eh, I gotta get out of this stupid costume.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, seriously you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey!&#39;,
 &#34;God damn it, don&#39;t shoot me!&#34;,
 &#39;I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.&#39;,
 &#39;Help! &#39;,
 &#34;What?! Scuzzlebutt&#39;s real?!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, cartoons kick ass! &#39;,
 &#34;Eh. You&#39;re making me sick, dude.&#34;,
 &#39;No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, let&#39;s see. Hey, Sylvester. &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll put a dollar on Sylvester.&#34;,
 &#34;Heh, he&#39;s doing something to his ass. He&#39;s not kicking his ass, but he&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;definitely doing something to his ass.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.&#39;,
 &#39;That dog is a gay homosexual.&#39;,
 &#34;Stan&#39;s dog&#39;s a homo. Stan&#39;s dog&#39;s a homo. &#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s homecoming?&#34;,
 &#39;There he goes again.&#39;,
 &#39;Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.&#39;,
 &#39;…And so you see, Simon &amp; Simon were not brothers in real life, only on &#39;
 &#39;television.&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, damnit!&#39;,
 &#39;Eeyy!&#39;,
 &#39;Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an &#34;A-&#34;?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not fair!&#34;,
 &#39;Stupid puppet. &#39;,
 &#39;You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan&#39;s little homo dog.&#34;,
 &#34;Man, that is the gayest dog I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;,
 &#39;He still looks pretty gay to me.&#39;,
 &#39;There he goes.&#39;,
 &#34;No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That&#39;s why he smote those &#34;
 &#39;sodomies in France.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Marty&#39;s Movie Reviews are on, kiick ass!&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants.  Ow!&#39;,
 &#39;Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ll just see about that.&#34;,
 &#34;No I didn&#39;t. That was just my shoes.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, you get back there.&#34;,
 &#34;Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I&#39;m worried &#34;
 &#39;about you man. &#39;,
 &#34;Hey Stan, where&#39;d you get that black eye?&#34;,
 &#39;Your sister beat you up again, huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.&#39;,
 &#34;I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I&#39;d be like, &#34;
 &#39;&#34;hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Be a man Stan. Just say, &#34;Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make &#39;
 &#39;babies.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.&#34;,
 &#39; If a woman ever gave me crap, I\&#39;d say, &#34;Hey, you go do my laundry and-&#34;&#39;,

 &#34;That&#39;s for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance &amp; Phillip last &#34;
 &#39;night!&#39;,
 &#39;Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time &#39;
 &#34;every month, Kyle&#39;s mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always &#34;
 &#39;end up getting screwed by it!&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, gee, I wonder who&#39;s mother that could have been?&#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle&#39;s mom!&#34;,
 &#34;Man! I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re gonna miss Terrance &amp; Phillip today. I think I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;already having withdrawal. &#39;,
 &#34;Just kill &#39;im dude, maybe he&#39;ll give you some money.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeh, like assisted suicide. What about that?&#39;,

 &#39;Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey you guys, Terrance &amp; Phillip is on!&#39;,

 &#39;My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! &#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is that thing?&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s no such thing as UFOs. &#34;,
 &#39;Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, dudes.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Adolph Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.&#34;,

 &#39;What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?&#39;,
 &#39;Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh look out, Holly Hobby&#39;s all pissed off! &#34;,
 &#34;Kenny&#39;s family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard &#34;
 &#39;box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard &#39;
 &#34;box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I&#39;m talking to you Kenny, achtung!  &#34;
 &#39;Poor piece of crap.&#39;,
 &#39;There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re just jealous! Why don&#39;t you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!&#34;,
 &#34; Wookies don&#39;t live on Endor.&#34;,
 &#39;What?! What did you say?!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my &#39;
 &#34;pudding, if you&#39;d like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.&#34;,
 &#34;Eating Kenny&#39;s pudding.&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That&#39;s right, &#34;
 &#34;Principal Victoria. It&#39;s okay with me because Eric is cool.&#34;,
 &#39;My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!&#39;,
 &#34;Eeehh, I don&#39;t want to see a educational video-o. &#34;,
 &#39; Lueden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Es ist zeit zu &#39;
 &#39;schlagen, God dammit!&#39;,
 &#39; Could I see that again? That was cool.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t, I have to win those two tons of candy.&#34;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t wanna be a stupid scary ghost!&#34;,
 &#34;Boo! I&#39;m a ghost.&#34;,
 &#34;Aw, come on Stan, maybe that&#39;s just because you look like a total choad.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Chef.&#39;,

 &#39;What is that?&#39;,
 &#39;Who?&#39;,
 &#34;Where the hell is Kyle, we don&#39;t have all night to wait for him.&#34;,
 &#34;Are you crazy?! I&#39;m the candy master.&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, I&#39;m not the one who walks around all day looking like Pippy &#34;
 &#39;Longstockings.&#39;,
 &#39;God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!&#39;,
 &#39;Check.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, granola pisses me off. &#39;,
 &#39;Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn&#39;t a paying job, or else Kenny&#39;s dad would be &#34;
 &#39;a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! &#39;
 &#34;Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family&#39;s poor!!!  I don&#39;t like Kenny &#34;
 &#34;anymore, he, he just doesn&#39;t communicate.&#34;,
 &#39;Hi Wendy.&#39;,
 &#39;You what?! Are you insane?!&#39;,
 &#39;How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?&#39;,
 &#39;Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.&#39;,
 &#39;You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!&#39;,
 &#34;Damn it! We&#39;ll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!&#34;,
 &#34;Heyy. They&#39;re all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap &#34;
 &#39;bastards!&#39;,
 &#39;Can we have some candy now please?!&#39;,

 &#34;Then, there won&#39;t be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!&#34;,

 &#34;Ok, let&#39;s go trick-or-treatin&#39; now, come on!&#34;,

 &#34; Well, let&#39;s go home, start eating that candy.&#34;,

 &#39;Lehh, eh, screw you guys!&#39;,
 &#34;Here you go, Kyle… And here&#39;s yours, Stan…&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re invitations to my birthday party this weekend.&#34;,
 &#34;Thaat&#39;s right. &#39;Cause it&#39;s my birthday, my bu bubu birthday…&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s ri-aayy.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip&#39;s invitation?? Let&#39;s see, &#34;
 &#34;Pip&#39;s invitation, Pip&#39;s invitation… Oh! I remember!  I shoved it up my ass!  &#34;
 &#34;Yeess, that&#39;s right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and &#34;
 &#39;then pleep shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of &#39;
 &#34;coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol&#39; chap!  Here&#39;s yours, Wendy… and &#34;
 &#34;here&#39;s yours, Clyde…&#34;,
 &#34;No, my birthday isn&#39;t until Saturday.&#34;,
 &#39;EEeeeeh!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?&#39;,
 &#34;Psych! I wasn&#39;t gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut &#34;
 &#39;your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk! &#39;,
 &#39;Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.&#39;,
 &#34;Right. That&#39;s what your supposed to get for my birthday.&#34;,
 &#34;Look, it&#39;s very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and &#34;
 &#39;Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three &#39;
 &#34;or it doesn&#39;t work, see?&#34;,
 &#34;Oooh. So maybe you don&#39;t want to have any of my mon&#39;s cake, pie, and ice &#34;
 &#39;cream, then.&#39;,
 &#34;Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family &#39;
 &#39;is. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. You can&#39;t sit with us, weirdo!&#34;,
 &#39;Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it &#39;
 &#39;on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!&#39;,
 &#39;Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!&#39;,
 &#39;Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee… Mega Cycle, which is what &#39;
 &#39;Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me &#39;
 &#34;the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated… here, but, I&#39;m changing your present &#34;
 &#39;to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a… duck-billed &#39;
 &#39;platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated… heuh, will &#39;
 &#34;be a gift given by two people at once, &#39;cause it costs more money… &#34;,
 &#34;Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can&#39;t have the fight &#34;
 &#39;on Saturday!&#39;,
 &#34;Cartman&#39;s birthday!&#34;,
 &#39;You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.&#39;,
 &#39;Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Satuday, huh?! This whole thing &#39;
 &#34;is a plot against me, isn&#39;t it?!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t mind him, Jesus, he&#39;s Jewish.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning &#39;
 &#39;everything down, you little bitch!&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn&#39;t mean to fart on you, I didn&#39;t have a &#34;
 &#39;choice! &#39;,
 &#34;You guys, shouldn&#39;t you be out shopping for my birthday presents?&#34;,
 &#39; Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, &#39;
 &#39;Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. Come on in and join the party. &#39;,
 &#39;Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega &#39;
 &#39;Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And &#39;
 &#34;what did Wendy get me? Oooh it&#39;s the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie &#34;
 &#34;and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It&#39;s the Red &#34;
 &#39;Mega-… Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? &#39;,
 &#39;YOU SON OF A BITCH! &#39;,
 &#34;YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN&#39;T MAKE THE ULTRA &#34;
 &#39;MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! &#39;,
 &#39;I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! &#34;
 &#34;THE PARTY&#39;S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! &#34;,
 &#39;Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! &#39;,
 &#39;Eh…n-yeh. No…more…pie…eheh…seriously.&#39;,
 &#39;Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.&#39;,
 &#39;And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!&#39;,
 &#39;Did you guys see that? That was sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, HEY!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s stupid, who the hell would want to do that?&#34;,
 &#39;KICK ASS!!&#39;,
 &#39;When do we get the sports watch?&#39;,
 &#39;You vas-deferens!&#39;,
 &#39;I get to wear it first, you guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.&#39;,
 &#34;When they cut up a chick&#39;s stomach to get a baby out?&#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not bringin&#39; in food for poor people, Screw them!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children &#39;
 &#39;calling!&#39;,
 &#34;Isn&#39;t it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I &#34;
 &#39;pay for?!&#39;,
 &#39;Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!&#39;,
 &#39;I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, Starvin&#39; Marvin.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey mooom?&#39;,
 &#39;We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet. &#39;,
 &#34;No no! He&#39;s my son! I adopted him.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That&#39;s why we all &#34;
 &#34;come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny&#39;s family &#39;cause to them $6.99 &#34;
 &#34;is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin&#39; Marvin? Is your dad &#34;
 &#34;an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin&#39; Marvin, these are what we call &#34;
 &#39;appetizers.&#39;,
 &#39;This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is &#39;
 &#34;here, that&#39;s it for the appetizers. &#34;,
 &#34;No Starvin&#39; Marvin, that&#39;s my pot-pie.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, you&#39;re right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t want all that, why don&#39;t you share it with me, man?  Just slide that &#34;
 &#39;right on over here. Let me just have some of that here…&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#34; No, Starvin&#39; Marvin, that&#39;s Kenny&#39;s creamed corn.  No Starvin&#39; Marvin, &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s a bad Starvin&#39; Marvin!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh well, back to the poor country with you.&#39;,
 &#39;B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, hey, what&#39;s going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I&#39;ll kick you in &#34;
 &#34;the nuts. D&#39;you hear me?!&#34;,

 &#39;Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here &#39;
 &#39;somewhere.  Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?  Well, &#39;
 &#34;screw you too!  What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;anybody ever heard of insect repellent?! &#39;,
 &#34;Damn, you guys, seriously, I&#39;m hungry. I have to eat.  Ah, sweet! The Red &#34;
 &#34;Cross!  I&#39;ll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.&#34;,

 &#34;But I&#39;m not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!&#34;,
 &#39;WEEEEEEAK!!!&#39;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t go on… need… appetizer… eh…  I&#39;m sorry, God, I&#39;m sorry I mocked poor &#34;

 &#34;Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom&#39;s closet too, and saw what I&#39;m getting. &#34;
 &#39;The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, but it sounds pretty sweet.&#34;,

 &#34;Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn&#39;t about gay &#34;
 &#39;cowboys eating pudding!&#39;,

 &#39;Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.&#39;,
 &#39;It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes!&#39;,
 &#39;Ay!&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, that&#39;s enough fatass jokes for this week.&#34;,

 &#39;Selling T-shirts kicks ass!&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. And I&#39;ve learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you &#34;
 &#34;make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don&#39;t have to hang out &#34;
 &#34;with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I&#39;ma goin&#39; home.&#34;,

 &#39;Okay, bye. &#39;,
 &#34;Stan? I&#39;m gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch. &#34;,
 &#34;Where the hell is everybody?! I&#39;m gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better &#34;
 &#39;not miss it!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, dude, here it comes!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  &#39;
 &#34;Ey! Didn&#39;t you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed &#34;
 &#39;it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! &#39;,
 &#39;What the hell are you talking about?&#39;,
 &#34;Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I&#39;m a hero. &#34;,
 &#34;God damnit, Mom, I wasn&#39;t pickin&#39; it! I have an itch!&#34;,
 &#39; Master thief, halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to &#39;
 &#39;destroy me!&#39;,
 &#39;I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih-&#39;,
 &#34;-special armor, that&#39;s impenetrable to American bullets.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s fine! I&#39;d like playing with myself! I&#39;ll play with myself all day &#34;
 &#39;long!  What?&#39;,
 &#39;El Commandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! &#39;,
 &#39;What are you guys doing?&#39;,
 &#34; A clubhouse? Heheh, that&#39;s the lamest thing I&#39;ve ever heard!&#34;,
 &#39; Wwwhy??&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s fine. We&#39;ll build our own clubhouse!&#34;,
 &#34;Fine! And then we&#39;ll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!&#34;,
 &#39;Fine!&#39;,
 &#34;Fine! That&#39;s fine. &#34;,
 &#39;Fine!&#39;,
 &#34;No, Kenny, you can&#39;t look! I&#39;m the foreman!&#34;,
 &#34;Because, Kenny, your family&#39;s poor! You have to be the worker!&#34;,
 &#39;Nno, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, it&#39;s not a treehouse, it&#39;s a clubhouse!&#34;,
 &#39;Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?&#39;,
 &#39; But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.&#39;,
 &#39;And stop your bitchin!&#39;,
 &#34;So, how&#39;s your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ll see about that.  Don&#39;t forget you need to cut school early and wait &#34;
 &#39;for the hot tub, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Mr. Garrison, Stan&#39;s behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.&#34;,
 &#39;Look at it, Kenny! It is the greatest clubhouse ever built! &#39;,
 &#39;And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test &#39;
 &#34;the foundation, run all kinds of expenses. I&#39;ve got way too much to do, and &#34;
 &#34;all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin&#39;!  Mom? Can &#34;
 &#39;I watch American Gladiators?&#39;,
 &#34;What the hell is goin&#39; on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any &#34;
 &#39;chicks to come to the clubhouse?&#39;,
 &#39; Holy crap!  Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!&#39;,
 &#39; Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage? Or a tasty snack? &#39;,
 &#34; How&#39;s the clubhouse coming, Stan?&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I just thought I&#39;d tell you that me and Kenny have finished our &#34;
 &#39;clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s only a matter of time before we&#39;re playin&#39; Truth or Dare with them. &#34;
 &#39;Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.&#39;,
 &#34;Ahaw, that&#39;s weak.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s killer.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s totally weak!&#34;,
 &#39;Sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Killer weak sweet!&#39;,
 &#39;I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I\&#39;m all like, &#34;Ey! I am not &#39;
 &#34;a little kid anymore! Ma, I&#39;m eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, &#34;
 &#39;then I\&#39;m gona fingerpaint!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her &#39;
 &#39;hole before I kick her in the nuts!&#39;,
 &#39; Coming, Mom.  Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!&#39;,
 &#39;Who the hell are you?!&#39;,
 &#39;How many people?&#39;,
 &#39; Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?&#39;,
 &#39;This is bullcrap! &#39;,
 &#34;This sucks, Kenny! I wish we&#39;d never built a clubhouse! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God, they killed Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Wwow!&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?&#39;,
 &#39;Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s easy!&#34;,
 &#39;Ay! Check it out!  Damn it!&#39;,
 &#39;Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! &#39;,

 &#34;Rican; that&#39;s why your family&#39;s so poor.&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the &#39;
 &#39;prostitutes, you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay.  Kugheek! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.&#39;,
 &#34; I wasn&#39;t saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city &#34;
 &#39;smells like ass.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s not funny, that sucks!&#34;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#39;Eh-heheh!&#39;,
 &#34;I told you Jewish people don&#39;t have rhythm!&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a &#39;
 &#39;million times back up in the States.&#39;,
 &#39; Bad! Bad monkey! &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m asserting myself. It&#39;s tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;bad I say, &#34;Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!&#34; and I smack him on the head!&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s bad! It&#39;s a bad three-toed sloth!&#34;,
 &#39; Respect my authoritah!&#39;,
 &#39; Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s a little wuss, what&#39;s it look like? &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!&#39;,
 &#34; Bad! That&#39;s a bad snay-ah! &#34;,
 &#39; Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and &#39;
 &#39;verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. &#39;,
 &#39;Y taco.&#39;,
 &#39;Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sick of this bullcrap! I&#39;m not following this hippie around anymore.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m going this way!&#34;,
 &#34;Look: you can stay over here, but I&#39;m going over here.&#34;,
 &#34;Nononono! You here, me here! Screw you guys, I&#39;ma going home.&#34;,
 &#39;God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch &#39;
 &#39;with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I &#39;
 &#34;knew it! I&#39;m saved! &#34;,
 &#34; Mister! You&#39;ve gotta help me! I&#39;m starving to death!&#34;,
 &#39;I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainfoest, and I need some &#39;
 &#34;food. I&#39;m fading fast!&#34;,
 &#39;Food! I have to have food! &#39;,
 &#39; Chicken wings. &#39;,
 &#39; Medium spicy. &#39;,
 &#34; Who&#39;d you expect? Merv Griffin?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend &#39;
 &#39;again?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don&#39;t-&#34;,
 &#39;What the hell happened to him?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna be Jesus!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, and like you&#39;re gonna do it, Jew?!&#34;,
 &#34;Either I&#39;m Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I&#39;m going home! &#34;,
 &#39;Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. &#39;,
 &#34; Stick and stones may break my bones, but I&#39;m Jesus and you aren&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#39;Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.&#39;,
 &#39; This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.&#39;,
 &#39;Peter!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I&#39;m Jesus, so I&#39;ll forgive you, I guess.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak &#39;
 &#39;for me.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone&#39;s sins will be &#34;
 &#34;forgiven.  So I guess it&#39;s cool. &#34;,
 &#39; Hi, mom. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. I told you I&#39;d be a sweet Jesus, you guys.&#34;,
 &#39;Up your ass with broken glass!&#39;,

 &#39;Get me down from here!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. And when I get down from here, I&#39;m gonna kick you both right in the &#34;
 &#39;nuts.&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, please can we just leave?&#39;,
 &#39;But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s what I told him, but he doesn&#39;t listen to reason.&#34;,
 &#39; Weak. &#39;,
 &#39; Hi, Dr. Lott&#39;,
 &#34; Ey! Don&#39;t call me a little piggy!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!&#34;,
 &#39; God damn it!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.&#39;,
 &#39;I am a little piggy.Ey!  That does it! Mom!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh gee! That&#39;s a good idea! My mom isn&#39;t paying you to be a comedian!&#34;,
 &#39;They look exactly the same.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, two!&#34;,
 &#39;Uh, one.&#39;,
 &#39; Two.&#39;,
 &#39;Ow! I hate you!&#39;,

 &#34;Why? I&#39;ll tell you why! Because he&#39;s a God-damned asshole, aaand, that&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;about it!&#39;,
 &#39;Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go &#39;
 &#34;back tomorrow, and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, yeah!  Ow!&#39;,
 &#39; Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little &#39;
 &#39;white guy.&#39;,
 &#39;Can I have the yellow with a side of white?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. &#34;,
 &#39; Ow!&#39;,
 &#39;My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, &#39;
 &#39;really mean.&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe it&#39;s just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him &#34;
 &#39;what a bitch she is.&#39;,
 &#39;Bitch, I hate that bitch!&#39;,
 &#39; Stop calling me piggy!&#39;,
 &#39;So, what does that mean?&#39;,
 &#34; All right. Right now, I&#39;m gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call &#34;
 &#34;me piggy one more time, I&#39;m gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your &#34;
 &#39;god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, dude! Super weak! I&#39;m not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on &#34;

 &#39; Uh, yeah, sure sure.&#39;,

 &#39;Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!&#39;,
 &#34;Ma&#39;am, we&#39;re having a dude moment here, if you don&#39;t mind?&#34;,

 &#34;But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he&#39;s marrying a succubuuus!&#34;,

 &#39;Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you &#39;

 &#39;Okay. &#39;,
 &#34;Aaah! It&#39;s the succubus! &#34;,
 &#39;What? What happened?&#39;,
 &#34;You guys, it&#39;s six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.&#34;,
 &#39;You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a &#39;
 &#39;succubus! I wanna go to sleep. &#39;,
 &#34; If we can hold on to the night.We&#39;ve got to find our way together…&#34;,
 &#39; What what what?&#39;,
 &#34;I wasn&#39;t sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!&#34;,
 &#39;Okay. &#39;,
 &#39;Ow! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh no! The tape jammed! &#39;,
 &#34; I can&#39;t see anything!&#34;,
 &#39; Got it! &#39;,
 &#39;What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?&#39;,
 &#34;After today they&#39;re gonna be fine, and I&#39;ll never have to see you ever &#34;
 &#39;again!&#39;,
 &#39;No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&#39;,
 &#39;Eh-sure.&#39;,
 &#39;Ooooohh.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.&#39;,
 &#39;Told ya!&#39;,
 &#34;I wonder why Kenny didn&#39;t wanna take shop class? &#34;,
 &#39;You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he &#39;
 &#39;is. &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek&#39;s ass.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll bet.&#34;,
 &#39;Five bucks.&#39;,
 &#39;Craig, could I talk to you real quick?  Er, just a second, please, Craig. &#39;
 &#34;Craig, I&#39;m not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, &#34;
 &#39;I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, &#39;
 &#39;and that, eh, well, you like it.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t Craig, I don&#39;t know. But now he&#39;s over there telling everybody that &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re a poop-eater and he chooses you.&#34;,
 &#34; No, no! Craig, you you can&#39;t fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it &#34;
 &#34;up. Tell you what: I&#39;ll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up &#34;
 &#39;for after school today.&#39;,
 &#34;You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He&#39;s gonna get his ass kicked.&#34;,
 &#34;Why don&#39;t we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!&#34;,
 &#34;Well, well, well, look who&#39;s here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!&#34;,
 &#39;Those sons of bitches!&#39;,
 &#34;Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You&#39;re supposed to be out fighting &#34;
 &#39;Tweek!&#39;,
 &#39;Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!&#39;,
 &#34; Well, that&#39;s fine. I guess you don&#39;t care about what Tweek said about your &#34;
 &#39;mom.&#39;,
 &#34; Egh. God-damnit!  Well, I guess you don&#39;t care about what Tweek said about &#34;
 &#39;your guinea pig.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;d be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for &#34;
 &#39;tomorrow?&#39;,
 &#39; After Red Racer, of course.&#39;,
 &#34; However long Craig wants it to last.  T&#39;heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. &#34;
 &#34;Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn&#39;t even view it &#34;
 &#39;as a challenge.&#39;,
 &#34;Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;mouth or something.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t call me fat, you son of a bitch! &#34;,
 &#34;When I have you guys&#39; ten bucks, I&#39;m gonna use it to buy the sweetest &#34;
 &#39;big-screen TV in the whole world.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that&#39;s like $2000&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gonna be eating those words, asshole.&#34;,
 &#39;Come on!&#39;,
 &#39;What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.&#39;,
 &#39;You just hit each other, smack each other around. &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very fair: if I teach Craig, he&#39;s gonna really kill &#34;
 &#39;Tweek.&#39;,
 &#34; Ooooo! Boxing&#39;s scary, you guys!  I&#39;m gonna have Craig learn martial arts!&#34;,
 &#39;Fine! &#39;,
 &#34;Fine, that&#39;s fine!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m ready!  Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. &#34;,

 &#39;Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to &#39;
 &#39;apologize. We feel so bad.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, you didn&#39;t see it? Oh. Tweek&#39;s family was on the news saying what a wuss &#34;

 &#39;prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!&#39;,
 &#39; What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, that&#39;s quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. &#34;
 &#39;Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your &#39;
 &#39;collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come &#39;
 &#39;home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her &#39;
 &#39;back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. &#39;
 &#34;Hurry, Kitty! You&#39;re my only hope!  That&#39;s it! That&#39;s it, Mr. Kitty! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh! God damnit!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!&#39;,
 &#39; You just want me to open the door!&#39;,
 &#39;What?? Ih is she okay?&#39;,
 &#39;Huh?! &#39;,
 &#39;Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is &#39;
 &#34;on his way right now to my mom&#39;s party with the picture!&#34;,
 &#34;Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that&#39;s why I wrote &#34;
 &#39;a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should &#39;
 &#39;anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!&#39;,
 &#34;O-kay! Let&#39;s see heuh. Haha! Um… Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! &#34;,

 &#39;every few years, mostly.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.&#39;,
 &#39;No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people &#39;
 &#34;that have a brother or a sister don&#39;t realize how lucky they are. Sure, they &#34;
 &#34;fight a lot, but you know there&#39;s always somebody there, somebody that&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;family.  I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you&#39;re my &#34;
 &#39;big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could &#39;
 &#34;watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;somebody&#39;s brother, if only for a day.&#34;,
 &#39;Yuh, you mean it?&#39;,
 &#34;Hooray!  Yes. I&#39;m gonna have your and your boyfriend&#39;s voices on my Speak &#34;
 &#34;and Record bear, and then you&#39;ll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.&#34;,
 &#39; Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my &#39;
 &#39;mother is away at a party right now.&#39;,
 &#39;That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelley Marsh, who is &#39;
 &#39;twelve.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelley&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!&#34;,
 &#39;Gotcha! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh wicky wicky Wild West! Shelley, guess who&#39;s busted!  &#34;
 &#34;Hey! I said, guess who&#39;s busted!  Eh, you&#39;re not gonna trick me, I&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#39;the goods on you!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, Shelley, he&#39;s 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re not ugly.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, you&#39;re pretty ugly, but, you don&#39;t have to be dating 22-year olds. I &#34;
 &#39;mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?&#39;,
 &#39;Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.&#39;,
 &#39;If you want, I could help you.&#39;,
 &#39;Just let me get my cowboy hat.&#39;,
 &#34; Okay, it&#39;s clear. &#34;,
 &#34;We don&#39;t have much time!&#34;,
 &#39;Hurry up in there!&#39;,

 &#39;Yeah. I think we get along okay.&#39;,
 &#34;Heh.  Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelley&#39;s fault! She didn&#39;t watch &#34;
 &#39;the cat!&#39;,
 &#39;Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.&#39;,

 &#39;Later.&#39;,
 &#39; Good morning, gentlmen.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. This year, I&#39;ve decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you &#34;
 &#34;guys, home. And may I say that we&#39;re going to whup your ass this time.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, really? I&#39;m pretty sure I just did.&#34;,
 &#39;Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes we are!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two &#39;
 &#39;assholes have to be my slaves for a month.&#39;,
 &#39;Right.&#39;,
 &#39;Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the &#39;
 &#39;battlefield. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeahah. He doesn&#39;t even know that the South loses the Civil War.&#34;,
 &#39;Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!&#39;,
 &#39; Hooray for the South!&#39;,
 &#39;But why? Why should they get the bell?&#39;,
 &#34;But we don&#39;t have to lose.&#34;,
 &#39; Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can &#39;
 &#39;go back to our families and say, &#34;We did it! We lost like we were supposed &#39;
 &#39;to! Aren\&#39;t we proud?!&#34; Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and &#39;
 &#39;when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, &#34;Not this &#39;
 &#39;year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And &#39;
 &#39;God bless the Confederasah!&#39;,
 &#39; So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?&#39;,
 &#39; I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a &#39;
 &#39;long shot. &#39;,
 &#39; Perhaps we should take Topeka.&#39;,
 &#34;They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;respect our authoritah.&#39;,
 &#39;No. I say we take Topeka.&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;ll bet you can&#39;t, because you guys are all pussies!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh! What was our bet again? Let&#39;s see… Yes, I remember. If the South wins &#34;
 &#39;you have to be my slaves for a month.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedon, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. &#39;
 &#34;Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I&#39;ll make sure you get lots of plunder &#34;
 &#39;and womens.&#39;,
 &#39; Excuse meh.&#39;,
 &#39;Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our &#39;
 &#39;way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: &#39;
 &#39;that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have &#39;
 &#39;taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will &#39;
 &#39;not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I &#39;
 &#39;hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee&#39;,
 &#39;Dear Ms. McCormick It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that &#39;
 &#39;your son Kenny was killed in battle  on the morning of November 18, at Ruby &#39;
 &#39;Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, &#39;
 &#39;and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we &#39;
 &#39;all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and &#39;
 &#39;make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very &#39;
 &#39;very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee&#39;,
 &#39; Where did the Confederates go, son?&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the &#39;
 &#34;sprinkles on &#39;em.&#34;,
 &#39; Where are you going?&#39;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! &#34;,
 &#39; No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!&#39;,
 &#39;God, I hate you guys!&#39;,
 &#34;This isn&#39;t over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! &#34;,
 &#39;Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far &#39;
 &#39;you came and all that you saw.&#39;,
 &#39; Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to &#39;
 &#39;take.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes! Yes!&#39;,
 &#39;Take the fort!&#39;,
 &#39;Suck my ass!&#39;,
 &#39;We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reenforcements are &#39;
 &#39;bound to show up.&#39;,
 &#39;I knew they would!&#39;,
 &#39;Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to &#39;
 &#39;Washington D.C.!&#39;,
 &#39;Dear Mr. President: There are times when humans can no longer endure their &#39;
 &#34;government&#39;s authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so &#34;
 &#39;that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet &#39;
 &#39;our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with &#39;
 &#39;Marisa Tomei.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t. I made it up. &#34;,
 &#39;What the hell are you guys doing?!&#39;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39;No! We still have to fight!&#39;,
 &#39;NOOO!!&#39;,
 &#39;WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!&#39;,
 &#39;Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!&#39;,
 &#34;Wait a minute! I don&#39;t have to be your slave.&#34;,
 &#39;The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!&#39;,
 &#39;Hahahaha haa ha!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, what the hell are you doing?!&#39;,
 &#34;Sure.  Here&#39;s a little dreidel that&#39;s small and made of clay. But I&#39;m not &#34;
 &#34;gonna play with it, &#39;cause dreidel&#39;s freakin&#39; gay.&#34;,

 &#39;And O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shining  It is the night of our &#39;
 &#34;dear Savior&#39;s b-b-bir-birth  O Holy Night, the- something something &#34;
 &#39;distant.  It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.  Jesus was born, &#39;
 &#39;and so I get presents.  Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)  Fall &#39;
 &#34;(Fall)  On your knees (On your knees)  And hear (Can&#39;t you hear) The &#34;
 &#34;angels&#39;… something (Voices) O night (O night)  Divine (Divine)  The night &#34;
 &#39;When I get presents (O-o)  O night (O o-night)  Divine!   O night (Ooo-ooo) &#39;
 &#39;O night divine!  Oh. Ch.&#39;,
 &#39; Time to go, Mr. Hankey.&#39;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys!  Guess what?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve become a man! I started puberty, you guys! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes! I really did.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, because yesterday I got my period. &#39;,
 &#34;My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child&#39;s life when &#34;
 &#39;they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass &#39;
 &#39;for a few days every month.&#39;,
 &#34;Well guys, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to hang out with you on New Year&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I&#39;m ma-ture.  I &#34;
 &#34;got my period, and you guys didn&#39;t. I got my period, and you guys didn&#39;t. &#34;,
 &#34;Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow &#39;
 &#34;stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one&#39;s got wings, you guys!&#34;,
 &#34;Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you&#39;re a man. &#34;
 &#34;We can hang out together on New Year&#39;s eve.  But first you need to buy some &#34;
 &#34;Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don&#39;t get blood on your &#34;
 &#39;underwear.&#39;,
 &#34;Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can&#39;t spend New Year&#39;s eve with a &#34;
 &#39;couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?&#39;,
 &#34;Tampon? What&#39;s a tampon?&#34;,
 &#34;Ew, doesn&#39;t that hurt?&#34;,
 &#39;Wow, cool!&#39;,
 &#34;All right! You have to be in me and Kenny&#39;s club, then. My mom gave me this &#34;
 &#39;&#34;Women Who Run With The Wolves&#34; book and I\&#39;m finding out all about our &#39;
 &#39;goddess powers.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for &#39;
 &#34;New Year&#39;s eve!  Hey, don&#39;t feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little &#34;
 &#39;later than others. &#39;,
 &#39; Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?&#39;,
 &#39;Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!&#39;,
 &#34;And I&#39;m here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our &#34;
 &#34;club for teens who have gotten their periods. We&#39;re supposed to talk about &#34;
 &#34;our periods. And boys. Let&#39;s talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty &#34;
 &#34;cool, but I don&#39;t think Clyde is very cool.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, that settles that. Now let&#39;s talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the matter, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;…Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.&#39;,
 &#34;Now, for our first club activity, we&#39;re supposed to reach into this little &#34;
 &#39;dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word &#39;
 &#39;means to us. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, look. It&#39;s that little boy who hasn&#39;t gotten his period yet.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, you shouldn&#39;t force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like &#34;
 &#39;the morning dew.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, we&#39;re going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there&#39;ll be some &#34;
 &#39;younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, the word is &#34;spirituality.&#34; I believe that the goddess in me is my &#39;
 &#39;spirituality because she-&#39;,
 &#39;Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-&#39;,
 &#39;God damnit, Kenny, shut the hell up!&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. &#39;,
 &#39;Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.&#39;,
 &#34;Buh- Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let&#39;s go see what &#34;
 &#39;kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his &#34;
 &#39;mom all night long.&#39;,
 &#34;Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle&#39;s mom says Kyle&#39;s getting really good at &#34;
 &#39;fingering, heh. &#39;,
 &#39;That was pretty cool.&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, how about this one, Kenny? &#39;,
 &#39;No? How about this? &#39;,
 &#34;Hm, interesting. Let&#39;s see: how about this? &#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re trying to find the brown noise—it&#39;s this one pitch, this certain &#34;
 &#39;frequency that makes people lose bowel control.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s a scientific term for crapping your pants.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!&#39;,
 &#39;How about this one, Kenny? &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s nice. When I find it I&#39;ll just make you crap yourself so you look &#34;
 &#39;like Karen Carpenter.&#39;,
 &#34; Stan, what&#39;s a queef?&#34;,
 &#39;Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!&#39;,
 &#39;Aaaa-&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!&#39;,
 &#39;I told you guys! Here it is, right here. &#34;The brown noise.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen.&#34; See? That means &#39;
 &#39;crap your pants. &#34;The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the &#39;
 &#39;lowest octave of Eb.&#34; What does that mean?&#39;,
 &#39;How about geebo, or, or mung?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, that&#39;s it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the &#34;
 &#34;lowest Eb is. Then we&#39;ll know the brown noise.&#34;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  &#39;
 &#34;There, okay. Let&#39;s see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?&#34;,
 &#39; Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch.  Okay. &#39;,
 &#39;I told you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.&#39;,
 &#39;Ooooh.&#39;,
 &#39;They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.&#39;,
 &#34;Lowest Eb, let&#39;s see. I think it looks like this. &#34;,
 &#34;Sweet. I can&#39;t wait to see them crap their pants infront of everybody, you &#34;
 &#39;guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh-oh. &#39;,
 &#34;Well, that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s fine. Next time, just remember that we&#39;re all &#34;
 &#34;pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I&#39;m saying, &#39;kay?&#34;,
 &#34;Ey! Don&#39;t call me fat, Token!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah! Why don&#39;t you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or &#34;
 &#39;something?!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;d kick your girlie ass in sledding!&#34;,
 &#34;Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I&#39;m gonna smack you &#34;
 &#39;on the head with this rock! &#39;,
 &#39;There! &#39;,
 &#39; Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sorry, Mom.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sorry, Token.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I &#39;
 &#39;thinking?  The only thing I can do now… is try to go on and live day by &#39;
 &#39;day.  See ya later.&#39;,
 &#39;No way!&#39;,
 &#39;…What the hell is a hate crime?&#39;,
 &#39;What? A federal offense?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no??&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, yes?&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s a black kid that goes to my school?&#34;,
 &#39;He is black.&#39;,
 &#39;I did?&#39;,
 &#39;No! I hate hippies!&#39;,
 &#39;I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about &#34;protectin\&#39; the &#39;
 &#39;earth&#34; and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear &#39;
 &#34;those stupid bracelets - I hate &#39;em! I wanna kick &#39;em in the nuts!&#34;,
 &#34; Ey! Don&#39;t call me fat, asshole!&#34;,
 &#39;No!&#39;,
 &#39; Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to &#34;
 &#39;Mexico!&#39;,
 &#39; Calm down, Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, come on! I don&#39;t have much time! &#34;,
 &#34;Damnit, Kenny! Can&#39;t this thing go any faster?!&#34;,
 &#34;Huh-who&#39;s Romper Stomper?&#34;,
 &#34;Uh… &#39;Cause I&#39;m just like you guys. Uh-I&#39;m one of you.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, uh, well, personally, I… uhuhuhuh, I… don&#39;t like Animaniacs?&#34;,
 &#34; Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we&#39;re friends now?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey you guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?&#39;,

 &#34;Been on the inside for so long, I don&#39;t rermember how to live on the &#34;
 &#39;outside.&#39;,
 &#39;When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, &#39;
 &#34;it&#39;s-&#34;,
 &#39;Hey. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, and I&#39;m not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.&#34;,
 &#39;Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, Romper Stomper.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, that&#39;s not all. I snuck something in for you, too.&#34;,
 &#39;You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?&#39;,

 &#39;Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-&#39;,
 &#39; Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! &#39;,
 &#39;Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me &#39;
 &#34;two dollars!  She&#39;s only given me a lousy quarter before!&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah! This is so tits!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, I mean, this is so cool!&#39;,
 &#34;Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I&#39;m goin&#39; to the toy &#34;
 &#39;store and buy me a skateboard! &#39;,
 &#34;Mom, you don&#39;t know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, &#34;
 &#34;okay? You&#39;re not the tooth fairy! I&#39;ll see you later!  Aw, man, this is so &#34;
 &#39;tits!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey you guys! You&#39;re not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, &#34;

 &#34;rich!  Aren&#39;t you stoked?!&#34;,
 &#39; Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! &#39;,
 &#39;For one tooth.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, that doesn&#39;t matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.&#34;,
 &#34;Look, I don&#39;t know why the tooth fairy&#39;s being so cool to me. Maybe she&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;hot for me. I don&#39;t know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide &#34;
 &#39;them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a  Sega Dreamcast.&#39;,
 &#39;All we need is teeth.&#39;,
 &#34; Kenny, think about it. Don&#39;t you want a  Sega Dreamcast?&#34;,
 &#34; Alright! Kenny&#39;s in, you guys! Tits!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and &#34;
 &#39;therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, &#39;
 &#39;anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  &#34;Oh, &#39;
 &#39;thank you, guys.&#34; You\&#39;re welcome, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;How are we gonna get it from him?&#39;,
 &#34;Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny&#39;s pengling, hahahahahaha.&#34;,
 &#39;Higher, you guys.&#39;,
 &#39; Agh! Careful, you assholes!  To the left, you guys, left.  No, camera left, &#39;
 &#34;camera left!  That&#39;s it, now down. &#34;,
 &#39; I am the tooth fairy, my child.&#39;,
 &#39;Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. &#39;,
 &#39;Ey!&#39;,
 &#39;Do not open your eyes until morning.  Or else I will kick you in the nuts.  &#39;
 &#39;Square in the nuts.&#39;,
 &#34;Bull&#39;s eye!&#34;,
 &#39;I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay.&#39;,
 &#34;Another tooth fell out today; I&#39;m leavin&#39; it for the tooth fairy.&#34;,
 &#39;I know, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You&#39;re not gonna believe it! It&#39;s beyond &#34;
 &#39;rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-&#39;,
 &#39;Four dollars. &#39;,
 &#39;Do you what this means?&#39;,
 &#39;Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!&#39;,
 &#39;You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the &#39;
 &#39;police!&#39;,
 &#39; You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. &#34;There\&#39;s no tooth fairy.&#34; &#39;
 &#34;I suppose you&#39;re gonna tell me there&#39;s no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or &#34;
 &#39;Jesus, either, heh, heh…  M- Mom?&#39;,
 &#34;Yi- you&#39;re serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?&#34;,
 &#39;How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?&#39;,
 &#39;How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh &#39;
 &#39;to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins &#39;
 &#39;Bear, of course.&#39;,
 &#39; No, Mother! No more lies! &#39;,
 &#39; There is no money.&#39;,
 &#39;I know!&#39;,
 &#34; You guys…  Oh, God, I don&#39;t even know how to tell you this.&#34;,
 &#34; You guys, there&#39;s… there&#39;s no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. &#34;,
 &#39;My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the &#39;
 &#39;ones who left you money.&#39;,
 &#34;But now my mom has given us so much money that she&#39;s bankrupt, and we&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;poor, like Kenny.  Don&#39;t touch me, Kenny. &#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, open your eyes, man!&#39;,
 &#34;Man, I can&#39;t believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.&#34;,
 &#34;No, man, that&#39;s just a TV show.&#34;,

 &#39;friends being &#34;mys-teriously&#34; arrested, huh?! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can&#39;t handle the fact &#34;
 &#34;that you&#39;re immature, and so you&#39;ve started a government conspiracy against &#34;
 &#39;me!&#39;,
 &#34;Lardbut. Oh, that&#39;s so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, &#34;
 &#39;huh?!&#39;,
 &#39;YES I AM!! &#39;,
 &#39;Dr. Mephesto, I need help.&#39;,
 &#39; You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna &#39;
 &#34;hang out with older friends, but I can&#39;t find any, so I was wondering if you &#34;
 &#39;could genetically engineer some older friends for me.&#39;,
 &#39;Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!&#39;,
 &#39;NAMBLA?&#39;,
 &#39;Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! &#39;,
 &#34;Yes. I&#39;d like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?&#34;,
 &#39;Sure.&#39;,
 &#39; …Sweet.&#39;,
 &#39; Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you &#39;
 &#34;gu-uys didn&#39;t!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and &#39;
 &#34;they all think that I&#39;m sure mature they want me to be their new poster &#34;
 &#34;child is all.  It looks like I&#39;m finally gonna have mature friends who I can &#34;
 &#34;relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I&#39;m too mature for you guys! &#34;
 &#39;Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! &#39;,
 &#39;Thanks, dude. &#39;,
 &#39;Really? Awesome!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan &#39;
 &#39;and Kyle, of course.&#39;,
 &#39;KIIICK ASS!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is &#39;
 &#39;having a very important benefit in my honor.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my &#34;
 &#34;mature friends that I want. And that means I&#39;m gonna invite everybody! &#34;
 &#39;Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, that&#39;s nice, &#39;cause you can&#39;t go.&#34;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t go.&#34;,
 &#34;No, you CAN&#39;T go.  Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out&#34;,
 &#39; What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for &#39;
 &#39;mature people only!&#39;,
 &#39;Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.&#39;,
 &#39; Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re all over the place.&#34;,
 &#34;Uuh, that&#39;s, that&#39;s fine. I know how to get us out.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, look. Those perverts aren&#39;t going to rest until they&#39;ve made love to &#34;
 &#34;one of us. Right? So,… somebody&#39;s just gonna have to go out there and and… &#34;
 &#39;take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. &#39;,
 &#39;Now, are you a team player or not?!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, Butters, there is no I in &#34;team.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Just go, Butters. We&#39;re running out of time.&#34;,
 &#34;Heh, he&#39;s such a dumba-a-ass.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, what?&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, alright, I&#39;m sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.&#34;,
 &#34;No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don&#39;t take too &#34;
 &#39;long. &#39;,
 &#39; Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.&#39;,
 &#39; (Here.)  Oh, hoho. Ow.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you&#39;re laughin&#39; so hard that the milk &#34;

 &#34; He&#39;s fakin&#39;! &#34;,
 &#34;But I don&#39;t want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Coming in for attack, Captain.&#34; Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, &#39;
 &#39;Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy &#39;
 &#39;the Gengrins on Crespus 5.&#39;,
 &#34;No, mine. M&#39;yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha &#34;
 &#39;ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, mom.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s goin&#39; on, guys?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh-kay.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh huh.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, I think I see where this is going. &#39;,
 &#34;Stan, why don&#39;t you just ask the question?&#34;,
 &#39; No no, no no, no! No no, no no, no!&#39;,
 &#39;No no, no no, nono no! Nonono, no no!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.&#39;,
 &#39;What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you &#39;
 &#34;start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn&#39;t seem to have much time. &#34;
 &#39;Tick-tock. Tick-tock.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  &#34;Quick, Captain, we must destroy the &#39;
 &#39;Gengrin across the fire.&#34; Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M\&#39;yah!&#39;,
 &#39;No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!&#39;,
 &#39; Shut up, Fluffy! &#39;,
 &#34;Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They&#39;re everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all &#34;
 &#39;they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! &#39;,
 &#34; whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it&#39;s Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are &#34;
 &#39;you?!&#39;,
 &#39; Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!&#39;,
 &#39;I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. &#39;,
 &#39;Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there&#39;s gonna be HELL &#34;
 &#39;to pay!&#39;,
 &#34;Thank you. And you&#39;d better hope to God it still works, just like it did &#34;
 &#39;before.&#39;,
 &#34;You see that?! That&#39;s MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I &#34;
 &#39;need it put back in!  Please.&#39;,
 &#34;No. Because. It doesn&#39;t belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It&#39;s MINE!&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you. &#39;,
 &#34; Heh. Hey, what what&#39;s going on?&#34;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!&#39;,
 &#34; I swear I&#39;m gonna kill you guys!!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.&#39;,
 &#34;Thaaat&#39;s ri-ight.&#34;,
 &#34;Nah-ah! I&#39;m just a better debater than you guys!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes I do!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I&#39;m going home! &#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m here.&#34;,
 &#39; Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to &#39;
 &#34;attack Stan and Kyle&#39;s credibility.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s how you win these things: attack your opponents&#39; credibility!  &#34;
 &#34;Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle&#39;s past. &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m talkin&#39; booby magazines, whatever.&#34;,
 &#39;The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for &#39;
 &#34;setting something on fire. Let&#39;s find out what that something was, and then &#34;
 &#39;lie and say it was a puppy.&#39;,
 &#39; Mmmm.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re right. We&#39;ll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they &#34;
 &#34;look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what&#39;s the issue again?&#34;,
 &#39;Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa! Calm down, ho. &#39;,
 &#39;I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone!  O yeah?! How would &#39;
 &#39;you like I should kick you in the nuts?!&#39;,
 &#34; Ugh. Oh yeah?! I&#39;ll kick you in the nuts!  Ugh. I&#39;ll kick you in the nuts!  &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ll kick you in the nuts!&#34;,
 &#34;You won&#39;t let me help.&#34;,
 &#34; …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We&#39;re in this &#34;
 &#34;together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I&#39;ll do it.  Wendih, let &#34;
 &#39;Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.&#39;,
 &#39; Uh huh.&#39;,
 &#34;Why don&#39;t we just talk about the swastika?&#34;,
 &#39;I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously &#39;
 &#34;history wasn&#39;t as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, &#34;
 &#39;so hey changed it.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Cool.&#39;,
 &#39;Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off &#39;
 &#39;of two cookies, and then put them together and make &#34;quadruple stuffs.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;No way!&#39;,
 &#39;Me neither.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh.&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa.&#39;,
 &#39; Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh! &#39;,
 &#39;Okay, It will be like this forever.&#39;,
 &#39;Me, too!&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, huhuh, he, haha.&#39;,
 &#34; And girl, you know that you&#39;re the only girl for me, girl. Girl, you&#39;re the &#34;
 &#34;girl of my fantasies. You&#39;re my girl, you&#39;re my girl,&#34;,
 &#39;My- …girrrrrrrl… &#39;,
 &#34;Yes! Yes! Yes, I&#39;m a star! I&#39;m a star! I&#39;m-  Aaawww, I&#39;m nobody! &#34;
 &#34;God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That&#39;s it, isn&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don&#39;t you? &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s it! &#34;,
 &#39; Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in &#39;
 &#39;our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I &#39;
 &#39;can make $10 million.&#39;,
 &#39;Boy band.&#39;,
 &#39;Boy band.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from &#34;
 &#39;God!&#39;,
 &#34;That didn&#39;t stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I&#39;ve got prerecorded &#34;
 &#39;music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our &#39;
 &#39;choreography over and over and over!&#39;,
 &#39;Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  &#39;
 &#34;So everybody get in a straight line, we&#39;re gonna listen to a song from the &#34;
 &#39;top, and take it-!&#39;,
 &#39;So?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34; Damnit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We&#39;ll put off practice for now, and hold &#34;
 &#39;auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be &#39;
 &#39;tomorrow morning!&#39;,
 &#34; Eheh, thank you Butters. We&#39;ll let you know.&#34;,
 &#34; We&#39;ll let you know, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, if we&#39;re gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we&#39;d better do &#34;
 &#39;it better than that.  Next!&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle&#39;s brother??&#34;,
 &#34;Chist&#39;s sake!&#34;,
 &#39; Next!&#39;,
 &#39; Next audition!&#39;,
 &#39; GOD-DAMNIT, NEXT!&#39;,

 &#34;Nobody&#39;s gonna notice?! What about her huge freakin&#39; hooters, huh?! &#34;,
 &#34;Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She&#39;s in until she &#34;
 &#39;screws up!&#39;,
 &#39;Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?&#39;,

 &#39;costumes!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah.  This one&#39;s yours, Stan. &#39;N this one is Kyle&#39;s. This one will cover up &#34;
 &#34;Wendy&#39;s hooters… &#34;,
 &#34;&#39;Cause I&#39;m like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one &#34;
 &#34;member that, you know, &#39;s tough.&#34;,
 &#39; …Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not-&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t be the tough one, because you&#39;re Jewish!&#34;,
 &#39;Since when?!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go &#39;
 &#39;through this! &#39;,
 &#39;I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you…  pretend to use your &#39;
 &#39;finger like a gun or something.&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, Kenny, what does &#34;fingerbang&#34; mean, then?&#39;,
 &#39;…What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would &#39;
 &#34;you?! Alright, boys, let&#39;s do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4,-!&#34;,
 &#34; Alright, guys. Let&#39;s do it like we rehearsed! We nned energy! We need to be &#34;
 &#39;up!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re goin&#39; to see the mall manager.&#34;,
 &#39; But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can &#39;
 &#34;do,  so that maybe we&#39;ll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the- uh.  &#34;
 &#39;Aaaa! Aaaa! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, God, I can&#39;t see! &#34;,

 &#39;Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. &#39;,
 &#39; Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.&#39;,
 &#34;I just don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn&#39;t toying &#34;
 &#39;with me. &#39;,
 &#39;Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The &#39;
 &#34;problem is, it isn&#39;t working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. &#34;
 &#34;But I just can&#39;t express it right, you know? &#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the Gomlich effect.&#34;,
 &#39;So how do boy bands use that?&#39;,
 &#39;Thanks!&#39;,
 &#39; Cucumber in the pants. Got it. &#39;,
 &#39;Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: &#39;
 &#39;The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by &#39;
 &#39;looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, &#34;Oh my God, it\&#39;s &#39;
 &#39;Fingerbang. Oh my God.&#34; Okay?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. &#34;,
 &#39;Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. &#39;,
 &#39;Waitwaitwaitwait, CUT!&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it&#39;s freakin&#39; &#34;
 &#39;Leonardo Di Caprio!&#39;,
 &#39;Fine! Who would you go crazy for?&#39;,
 &#34;…Okay, fine! Pretend that we&#39;re Matt Lauer.&#34;,
 &#39;Roll camera!&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#34;Aaand CUT.  Alright, our video&#39;s complete. Through the grace of God I can &#34;
 &#34;now go back to that mall manager and show him what ve&#39;ve got!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh uh, Kyle has it. &#39;,
 &#39;Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. &#39;
 &#39;There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. &#39;,
 &#39; Hello again!&#39;,
 &#34;I know you didn&#39;t love our audition. But now we have a video.&#34;,
 &#39; If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! &#39;,
 &#39;Uh God damnit! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was &#39;
 &#39;really cool. &#39;,
 &#39;Son of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#34; You don&#39;t understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what &#34;
 &#39;God want me to do. Ple-ease.&#39;,
 &#39;Really? You will?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o&#39;clock?&#34;,
 &#39;Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! &#39;,
 &#39;Aw, mom!&#39;,
 &#39;Where the hell is Stan?!&#39;,
 &#39;I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will HAVE HIS NUTS!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we&#39;re just waiting on one more member.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah. We&#39;ll start right away.  We&#39;ll have to do it without him.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, God-damnit!&#39;,
 &#39;God damnit! People are walking away! &#39;,
 &#39;Just another minute.&#39;,
 &#34; Well God, I guess you got me again, didn&#39;t you? Hyeah, that was a good one, &#34;
 &#39;God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! &#39;,
 &#34; Sir! We&#39;re all here now! Can we go on, please?&#34;,
 &#39;We will!  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy &#39;
 &#39;band of the countrih! Someday you will all be among those who can say, &#34;I &#39;
 &#39;saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.&#34;  And &#39;
 &#39;so, without further ado, all five members of the…&#39;,
 &#34; No! He can&#39;t be dead!&#34;,
 &#39;No! We were so close!&#39;,
 &#39;But we have to perform!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!&#39;,
 &#39;Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank youuuu, yes!&#39;,
 &#39;Ok- Okay okay&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, yeah, maybe.  God. Now it&#39;s like everybody wants a piece of us.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I&#39;d &#34;
 &#34;wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don&#39;t know if I like it. I mean, I &#34;
 &#34;probably can&#39;t even walk through this mall right now without people goin&#39;, &#34;
 &#39;&#34;Oh my God, it\&#39;s the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, screw God. I&#39;m not scared o&#39; him. He&#39;s a pussy.  You know I&#39;m just &#34;
 &#34;kiddin&#39;, right? Heheyeah. &#34;,
 &#39; Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? &#34;It\&#39;s a man\&#39;s &#39;
 &#34;obligation to stick his boneration in a woman&#39;s separation.  This sort of &#34;
 &#39;penetration will increase the population of the younger generation.&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;&#34;It\&#39;s a man\&#39;s obligation to stick his boneration in a woman\&#39;s separation  &#39;
 &#39;to increase the population of the younger generation.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;No no, no. Separation.&#39;,
 &#39; Ugh!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. I&#39;ll see ya later, mom. &#34;,
 &#34;A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we&#39;re safe?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, what if we haven&#39;t?&#34;,
 &#39;Jesus was made of crackers?&#39;,
 &#34;So wwe won&#39;t go to hell as long as we eat crackers.&#34;,
 &#39; Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! &#39;,
 &#39; Nno!&#39;,
 &#39;But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yeah, okay.&#39;,
 &#39;Right, I already got that one.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, he&#39;s Jewish. He doesn&#39;t have to confess his sins.&#34;,
 &#34;No, you&#39;re already going to hell.&#34;,
 &#39;You are, too!&#39;,
 &#34;Alright. That was mostly Kenny&#39;s fault.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;d we do to Timmy?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, you&#39;re right. I guess Timmy&#39;s pretty screwed.&#34;,
 &#39; How was it?&#39;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s in there?&#34;,
 &#39;Well, here goes everything. &#39;,
 &#39; Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, let&#39;s see. I&#39;d like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a &#34;
 &#39;half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like &#39;
 &#39;tiny beads of glass…&#39;,
 &#39;And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t tell anybody about this stuff, right?&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church &#39;
 &#39;had been eating.&#39;,
 &#34;No, but I&#39;m not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was &#34;
 &#39;eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and &#39;
 &#39;then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and &#39;
 &#39;the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a &#39;
 &#39;week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out &#39;
 &#39;walking his dog and I went-… number two on the sidewalk and then told &#39;
 &#34;officer Barbrady that it was the priest&#39;s dog.  And so the priest got find &#34;
 &#39;like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put &#39;
 &#34;super glue all over the priest&#39;s bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D&#39;ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! &#34;
 &#39;Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!&#39;,
 &#39; Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.&#39;,
 &#39;I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you &#39;
 &#39;guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.&#39;,
 &#39; Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!&#39;,
 &#39;Turn around so I can clean out your ass.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, now you&#39;ve said it, too!&#34;,
 &#34;Aw, dude, we&#39;ve gotta go back to church and confess again.&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! &#39;,
 &#39;And he never took Communion!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. &#39;,
 &#39;Come on, hurry up! &#39;,
 &#34; What? No! It shouldn&#39;t be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess &#34;
 &#39;our sins before we die!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m first, I&#39;m first! &#34;,
 &#39; What the? &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re doing unnatural things in the house of God!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, it looks like we&#39;re gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else &#34;
 &#39;in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!&#39;,
 &#34;We have-uh repeatedly broken God&#39;s commandments-uh! We have lived our lives &#34;
 &#39;for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh!  If thy hand offend thee, &#39;
 &#39;cut it off!  It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-&#39;,
 &#39;-than having two hands to go into hell-uh,-&#39;,
 &#39;-into the fire that will never be quenched!&#39;,
 &#39;There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start &#39;
 &#39;anew!&#39;,
 &#39;It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am &#39;
 &#39;going to lead you there!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, it looks like we&#39;re gonna have to save everyone in this town &#34;
 &#39;ourselves!&#39;,
 &#39;I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The LORD is powerful and he &#39;
 &#39;will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not &#39;
 &#39;live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! &#39;,
 &#39;Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going &#39;
 &#39;eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  &#39;
 &#39;God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell. So when will you &#39;
 &#39;go?! Tomorrow?! Ten years?! Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give &#39;
 &#39;this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship &#39;
 &#39;God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new &#39;
 &#39;church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that &#39;
 &#39;connects this part hmya  to this part hmya . Who will help us?&#39;,
 &#39;Praise God-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.&#39;,
 &#39;Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. &#39;,
 &#39;No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, oh temptress!&#39;,
 &#39;This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you &#39;
 &#39;can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered dougnut &#39;
 &#39;pancake surprise! For it is the AFTERLIFE we have concerned ourselves with!  &#39;
 &#39;Not the pleasures of this earth, but salvarion in the world aftah!!&#39;,
 &#39;Let us get back to our work at the church  Yea. I shall answer the phone, &#39;
 &#39;hyah.  Hello?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh my God!!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Kenny. He&#39;s calling from beyond the grave!&#34;,
 &#39;Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!&#39;,
 &#39; Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from &#39;
 &#39;beyond the grave-eh.  It was our departed friend, Kennih! Calling from the &#39;
 &#39;depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh.  He &#39;
 &#39;said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks &#39;
 &#39;Spanish.&#39;,
 &#39;He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your &#39;
 &#39;ass for seven hours-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little &#39;
 &#39;trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!&#39;,
 &#39; We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! &#39;,
 &#39;Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!&#39;,
 &#39;The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins!&#39;,
 &#34;Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We&#39;re sorry, Whatever &#34;
 &#34;we did, we&#39;re sorry.&#34;,
 &#39;Let\&#39;s see. Matthew 15:11. &#34;Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a &#39;
 &#39;man; but that which comes OUT of the mouth defileth a man.&#34; That\&#39;s a good &#39;
 &#39;one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. &#39;,
 &#39;Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. &#39;,
 &#39;Sister, have you read this book.&#39;,
 &#34;Then you know what it says happens to those who don&#39;t follow the Lord-uh.&#34;,
 &#34;Are you saying that what the Bible says isn&#39;t true?&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this &#34;
 &#34;town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we&#39;ve decided to save &#34;
 &#39;ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa.&#39;,
 &#39;Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you &#39;
 &#39;believe in God-uh?!&#39;,
 &#39;Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin&#39; out of your body, &#34;
 &#34;bein&#39; replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!&#34;,
 &#34;Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o&#39;ya?&#34;,
 &#39;Praise the Lord-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;For he is Lord, he is Lord… Bring up the next person!  This boy has been &#39;
 &#39;crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!&#39;,
 &#39;We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;Devil be  GOAN-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;Now WALK, Timmih! &#39;,
 &#39; Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;The Lord wants you to walk,Timmih! Oo-WALK, Timmih! &#39;,
 &#39;He walks-uh!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes! Praise the Lord!&#39;,
 &#39;For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Where are you from, little boy? &#39;,
 &#39;And God is telling me that you have… bad eyesight. Is that it?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! &#39;,
 &#39;For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Right here we have a little girl who is &#39;
 &#39;very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!&#39;,
 &#39;He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!&#39;,
 &#39; Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say &#34;Amen!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Halleluyah! Praise the Lord! And now, I&#39;m receiving a message directly from &#34;
 &#39;God-uh! God is telling me that… each and every one of you is to walk up to &#39;
 &#39;the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of &#39;
 &#34;God by coming up heah , and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;be shy! Come on now! &#39;,
 &#39; Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!&#39;,
 &#39;Eheverybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have &#39;
 &#39;it all!&#39;,
 &#39;Of course, you guys! And then we can make… ten million dollars!  Look, the &#39;
 &#34;tooth fairy thing didn&#39;t work, the boy band thing didn&#39;t last, so I tried &#34;
 &#39;this route.&#39;,
 &#39;It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn&#39;t send us to hell. Even Sister &#34;
 &#39;Anne told me that.&#39;,
 &#34;My brain is of a much larger size than you guys&#39;s. I couldn&#39;t expect you to &#34;
 &#39;understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!&#39;,
 &#39; Suck my balls!&#39;,
 &#34;Today is another day! And that&#39;s another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! &#34;
 &#39;So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! &#39;,
 &#39;Sister Anne is a blasphemer!&#39;,
 &#39; Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#39; Jesus, ixnay on the oolschay.&#39;,
 &#39; Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!&#39;,
 &#34; No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can&#39;t be &#34;
 &#39;cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gonna send me to hell?&#34;,
 &#39; Aw, crap!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah,  get out of here! &#39;,
 &#34;There, that&#39;s better.&#34;,
 &#39;U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. &#39;,
 &#34; Why, that&#39;s PERfect!&#34;,
 &#39; Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?&#39;,
 &#39; KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, I&#39;m sure I do.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m trying.&#34;,
 &#39; Fantastic, then.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys are all such pussies!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for &#39;
 &#39;granted.&#39;,
 &#34;Everything was great in third grade. And now that it&#39;s all over, we&#39;er &#34;
 &#39;starting to see just how special it was. Remember how it used to be in the &#39;
 &#39;Third Grade? We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third &#39;
 &#39;Grade  We learned wonderous things from a teacher so nice  Sat on &#39;
 &#39;marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles  The world seemed to all make &#39;
 &#39;sensebut that sense seems to slowly fade  After Third Grade In the Third &#39;
 &#39;Grade we used to write with crayons  We would make sparkly pictures with &#39;
 &#39;glitter and glue  We had warm cookies and hearts full of love  And there &#39;
 &#34;wasn&#39;t a care in the world of me… of you…  There&#39;s not a thing in this life &#34;
 &#34;that I wouldn&#39;t trade just to go back for one minute  To Third Grade &#34;,
 &#39; I wish I was sstill there.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, if there&#39;s a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know &#34;
 &#39;how!&#39;,
 &#39;Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.&#39;,
 &#39; Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-&#39;,
 &#34;We didn&#39;t do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn&#39;t feel like it!&#34;,
 &#34;Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I&#39;m afraid we have different plans! &#34;
 &#39;Gentlemen? &#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall &#34;
 &#39;see you in another year! Hahaaa! &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re damn right they do!&#34;,
 &#34;Look, dude, can&#39;t you just build us another machine without him?&#34;,
 &#39;Who the hell cares?!&#39;,
 &#39;God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!&#39;,
 &#34;Haha, Teacher, we&#39;re traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you &#34;
 &#34;guys, you seriously said this time you&#39;d snap into it with me.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes! We&#39;ve had a new time maching built: this one out of a simple microwave &#34;
 &#39;oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perheps we shall see you in the past, &#39;
 &#39;hahaa. Gentlemen? &#39;,
 &#39;There it is! Come on, everybody! &#39;,
 &#39;No way, lady!&#39;,
 &#39;You can suck my balls!&#39;,
 &#39;…What?&#39;,
 &#39;Touché, teacher. Touché.&#39;,
 &#39;What??&#39;,
 &#34; Hey, dudes, check out my sweet Dawson&#39;s Creek Trapper Keeper Ultrakeeper &#34;
 &#34;Futura 2000!  Yeah, well , it&#39;s got ten different compartments for every &#34;
 &#39;subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with &#39;
 &#34;electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson&#39;s Creek on &#34;
 &#34;the back than Kyle&#39;s,  flat-screen TV, and of course, On-Star.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepeh- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, &#39;
 &#34;didn&#39;t you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not a genius, he&#39;s a little douche bag.&#34;,
 &#39;Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate &#39;
 &#39;music, country, high volume. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s me.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeahhh, you already know about it??&#39;,
 &#39;Well! &#34;Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; Here, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#34;And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle&#39;s is &#34;
 &#39;that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take &#39;
 &#39;something as simple as this calculator  and… Trapper Keeper?&#39;,
 &#39;Hybrid with Wellington Bear Calculator.&#39;,
 &#39;And now it can use Wellington Bear Calculator, too.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh, n-no, I&#39;m afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on &#34;
 &#39;my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out &#39;
 &#39;and pierce through their hands.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh really?  Then, why don&#39;t you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.&#39;,
 &#39; Hold it.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, dude. I&#39;m not supposed to have any male friends that are over &#34;
 &#39;30. I kind of screwed on that once.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you can&#39;t just ask to be somebody&#39;s friend and be their friend, It &#34;
 &#34;doesn&#39;t work that way. If you want to be my friend, you&#39;ll have to pay me.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, that&#39;s cool.&#34;,
 &#39;Ah- alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play &#39;
 &#39;tetherball with some- .&#39;,
 &#39;Ugh. &#39;,
 &#39;Ey!&#39;,
 &#39;You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper &#39;
 &#39;homing device. &#39;,
 &#34;Turn left here! We&#39;re getting close! Get your gun ready!&#34;,
 &#34; It was NOT a school folder, it was a Dawson&#39;s Creek Trapper Keeper Futura &#34;
 &#39;S2000! And if-!  There he is!&#39;,
 &#39;Got ya! &#39;,
 &#39;Aah, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you? &#39;,
 &#39; Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.&#39;,
 &#39;…You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon &#39;
 &#39;sharpener?&#39;,
 &#39;What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old &#39;
 &#34;Trapper Keeper like Kyle&#39;s?! Is that what you want?!&#34;,
 &#34;Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You&#39;ll find it on &#34;
 &#39;the bottom of your shoes! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey, dudes.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the &#34;
 &#39;last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she &#39;
 &#39;took me to the store and bought me a NEW one!  So everything worked out.&#39;,
 &#39;Why the hell not?!&#39;,
 &#39;Wait… sso then you guys burned my last one for no reason!&#39;,
 &#34; But I don&#39;t think I can get my mom to buy me another one.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think?! I think this whole thing &#39;
 &#34;is a SETUP! That&#39;s right! Kyle got this guy to say that he&#39;s a robot from &#34;
 &#34;the future just because he&#39;s jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what &#34;
 &#34;else?! Screw you guys, I&#39;m going home! &#34;,
 &#39;Ech! Screw you guys, home! &#39;,
 &#34;Sweet. You&#39;re so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take &#34;
 &#34;you away. I don&#39;t wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper forever The ways of my &#34;
 &#39;Trap-&#39;,
 &#39;Oh! Cool.&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa.&#39;,

 &#39;let my Trapper Keeper get-&#39;,
 &#39;Screw you guys, screw you guys. Screw you guys, scr-&#39;,
 &#39;Huh? &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, sweet. What&#39;s it gonna hybrid with now? &#34;,

 &#34;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you do that, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey-eh, screw you.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh! &#39;,

 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#34;Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I&#39;ll bump you up to 10%.&#34;,
 &#39; Suck my balls, 20!&#39;,
 &#39;Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents thnk that &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;both screwed! &#39;,
 &#34; Alright, they&#39;re gone!  The Cartman store is open! &#34;,
 &#39; Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you &#39;
 &#39;crying, Chad?&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, Chad, eh… You know what you need? You need a friend.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn&#39;t judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy &#34;
 &#39;Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  &#39;
 &#34;…There you go. That&#39;ll just be four dollars.  …There you go.&#34;,
 &#39; …65, 66, 67… &#39;,
 &#39; Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!&#39;,
 &#34;You know? You guys are right. I&#39;m sick of being the fat kid, too. I&#39;ve been &#34;
 &#39;making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took &#39;
 &#39;responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we &#39;
 &#39;really can lose the weight! &#39;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, screw you, fatasses! &#39;,
 &#39;No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!&#39;,
 &#34;Dummy, you don&#39;t ask if you can go! I&#39;m telling my parents I&#39;m staying at &#34;
 &#34;Stan&#39;s house, Stan&#39;s telling his parents he&#39;s staying at Kenny&#39;s house, and &#34;
 &#34;Kenny&#39;s not telling his parents anything, &#39;cause they&#39;re alcoholics and they &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t care!&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I guess you&#39;re screwed, then. &#34;,
 &#39; Well, you… could make them… go away for a while.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, I mean, you… could… call the police and have them take your parents &#39;
 &#39;away.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your &#39;
 &#39;parents both molestered you.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom&#39;s last &#34;
 &#39;boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I &#39;
 &#34;haven&#39;t seen him for three months.&#34;,
 &#39;You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have &#39;
 &#39;to be like,  &#34;my parents molestered me.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;No, but you\&#39;ve gotta cry, like this:  &#34;My parents molestered me.&#34;  And then &#39;
 &#39;they\&#39;ll say somethng like, &#34;Was it a good touch or a bad touch?&#34; and you &#39;
 &#39;say  &#34;Ih, it was a good touch&#34; or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.&#39;,
 &#34;Something about a swimsuit - I don&#39;t remember, but you definitely answer &#34;
 &#39;&#34;bad touch.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he&#39;s ready.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!&#39;,
 &#39; You guys! Come out here! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, nothing. There&#39;s not an adult left in town.  They&#39;ve all been &#34;
 &#34;arrested, and the ones that weren&#39;t arrested have moved away because they&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;scared of being arrested&#39;,
 &#34;Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won&#39;t you come in, please?  Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, &#34;
 &#39;as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.&#39;,
 &#34;Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They&#39;re not around.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions &#39;

 &#39;is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have &#39;
 &#34;the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we&#39;ll get you &#34;
 &#39;what you need. &#39;,
 &#39;Where is your husband?&#39;,
 &#39;Seize her! &#39;,
 &#39; Outlander! &#39;,
 &#39;Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her &#39;
 &#39;blood was fair!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, calm down, ahright?&#39;,
 &#39;I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female &#39;
 &#39;gets it! &#39;,
 &#39;Heh, heheh.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re running outu of time! Hand our book over, quick!&#34;,
 &#39;The Provider awakes!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;ll call the police and say you molestered us, too.&#34;,
 &#39;Take him down. &#39;,
 &#39;Snow igloos kick ass. &#39;,
 &#34;Aw, Jesus Christ! I&#39;m going back to bed. &#34;,

 &#39;My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can &#39;
 &#39;star us instead of these little round-headed guys!&#39;,
 &#39; Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.&#39;,

 &#39;What- What are you doing??  No!.. wuh...why?&#39;,
 &#34;Noooooooooo! ...You&#39;ll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!&#34;,
 &#39; Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply &#39;
 &#39;troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott &#39;
 &#39;Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!&#39;,
 &#39; Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating &#39;
 &#39;mind, and I will have revenge!&#39;,
 &#39;Did you guys see that movie Hannibal? Where the deformed guy trained giants &#39;
 &#39;pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. &#39;
 &#34;Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman&#39;s weiner.  It will be painful and &#34;
 &#39;humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will &#39;
 &#39;forever be known as the kid who had his weiner bitten off by a pony!!! &#39;
 &#39;WAHAHAHAHAA!!!&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. &#39;
 &#34;Hell, let&#39;s let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what&#39;s ours and &#34;
 &#39;laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out &#39;
 &#39;of here right now and say, &#34;It\&#39;s not your problem.&#34; But... years from now, &#39;
 &#34;when you&#39;re old and have children of your own, what would you give to come &#34;
 &#39;back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a &#39;
 &#39;difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, &#34;You may take our &#39;
 &#34;pride, but you&#39;ll naver take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve &#34;
 &#39;cents!!&#34;  Now who\&#39;s with me?!! &#39;,
 &#34; Christ. Alright, I guess it&#39;s just you and me, Timmy!&#34;,
 &#39;There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the weiner. Bite it.  &#39;
 &#34;Come on, good pony. That&#39;s it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the weiner! Good &#34;
 &#34;pony!  Oh no, pony, he&#39;ll like that.&#34;,
 &#34;No, I&#39;m trying to teach it how to bite someone&#39;s penis off. &#34;,
 &#39;He said it was okay.&#39;,
 &#39;Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!&#39;,
 &#39; Not like that, pony! &#39;,
 &#39;Whattayou mean?&#39;,
 &#39;How do I do that?&#39;,
 &#39;I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and &#39;
 &#39;his- Goaddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!&#39;,
 &#34;Right, right. Let&#39;s see... There&#39;s posters. Radiohead posters! And he&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;reading a magazine about Radiohead!&#39;,
 &#34;You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I&#39;m a creep. I&#39;m a winner...&#34;,
 &#39;So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  &#39;
 &#34;li&#39;l ol&#39; scheme  that involves them.&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m looking in Scott&#39;s parents&#39; room. Scott&#39;s mom&#39;s about to take off her &#34;
 &#39;bra.&#39;,
 &#39;Radiohead. Yes, of course. &#39;,
 &#34; Oh, hey, Scott. How&#39;s it goin&#39;? I was just wondering, do you like the band, &#34;
 &#39;uh, Radiohead at all?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, really? Oh, &#39;cause, they&#39;re doin&#39; a big interview on MTV, and they&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;playing it tonight on a big screen downtown.  Everyone&#39;s gonna be there!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re welcome, Scott. &#34;,
 &#34;Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let&#39;s play the video, shall we? &#34;,
 &#34; That&#39;s an interesting question, Kurt. But first I&#39;d just like to say that I &#34;
 &#34;really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He&#39;s stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott &#34;
 &#39;Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? &#39;,
 &#39; Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that &#39;
 &#34;we don&#39;t want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He&#39;s not cool!&#34;,
 &#39;Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see &#39;
 &#39;that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know &#39;
 &#34;what? That wasn&#39;t really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! &#34;
 &#39;HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m a little piggy; here&#39;s my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink. &#34;,
 &#34; That does it! I&#39;m gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!&#34;,
 &#34;Hueah. You think you&#39;re so cool, Scott Tenorman? We&#39;ll see how cool you feel &#34;
 &#39;after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It &#39;
 &#39;is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met &#39;
 &#39;meee!!! &#39;,
 &#39;Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!&#39;,
 &#39;How to get Scott Tenorman back!&#39;,
 &#34;I just finished planning a brilliant  li&#39;l scheme  that should put Scott in &#34;
 &#34;his place for good! And if you help me, I&#39;ll give each of you... two... &#34;
 &#39;dollars. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;favorite band is Radiohead, right?&#39;,
 &#39;So, I realized, &#34;What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?&#34; &#39;
 &#39;right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his weiner &#39;
 &#39;bitten off by a pony! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott&#39;s weiner in front of &#34;
 &#39;Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say &#39;
 &#39;Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna &#39;
 &#34;die!!  Okay, I&#39;ll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to &#34;
 &#39;play here! Ready? Break!! &#39;,
 &#34;...Fine, I&#39;ll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  &#34;
 &#39;Yes!! &#39;,
 &#39; Hello, Scott!&#39;,
 &#34;I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It&#39;s a chili &#34;
 &#34;cook-off with rides.  Everyone&#39;s coming, and I wanted to drop by your &#34;
 &#39;invitation personally!&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won&#39;t wanna miss it, &#34;
 &#34;Scott.Oh, and here! Here&#39;s a coupon good for one free pony ride!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.&#39;,
 &#39; A little penis-biting, perhaps?&#39;,
 &#34;Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you&#39;ll come for sure then, Scott?&#34;,
 &#39;Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very &#39;
 &#39;good. &#39;,
 &#39; Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!&#39;,
 &#34; Ohoho, it won&#39;t be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay &#34;
 &#39;to see the fireworks!&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;,
 &#39;Not yet, but they will be.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, Chef.&#39;,
 &#39;What contest?&#39;,
 &#39;Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.&#39;,
 &#39; Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! &#39;,
 &#34; Likewise. Well, come on, you&#39;ve got to see the pony!&#34;,
 &#34;Well, e-yeah, but, there&#39;s a special guest coming, and I want you to be near &#34;
 &#39;the pony when they arrive.&#39;,
 &#34; Alright, Scott, uh. Let&#39;s go over to the judging table and we&#39;ll try the &#34;
 &#39;chili first.  Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#34; Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here&#39;s mine. &#34;,
 &#39;Alright.  Hey, this is great! &#39;,
 &#39; Gawh, this is really good, Scott!&#39;,
 &#39;What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? &#39;,
 &#34;Yehes, I&#39;m afraid this isn&#39;t your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef&#39;s.  &#34;
 &#34;It&#39;s delicious, Chef. I hadn&#39;t planned on that. What I did plan on, however, &#34;
 &#39;was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the &#39;
 &#39;Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I &#39;
 &#34;had trained Denkins&#39; pony to bite off your weiner. What they didn&#39;t tell you &#34;
 &#39;was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing &#39;
 &#39;that you would try and do somethng to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that &#39;
 &#34;violent pony killers were in the area.  I also know that you wouldn&#39;t go &#34;
 &#39;yourself, for fear of having your weiner bitten off. You would most likely &#39;
 &#34;send your parents.  And, I&#39;m afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on &#34;
 &#39;his property, he shot and killed both your parents. &#39;,
 &#39;I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer &#39;
 &#39;Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the &#39;
 &#39;hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could &#39;
 &#34;tell you personally about your parents&#39; demise! And of course, feed you your &#34;

 &#39; Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so &#39;
 &#39;yummy and sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-ymmuy.  Mm-yummy you guys!  &#39;
 &#34;Yuppitibut, that&#39;s all, folks! &#34;,
 &#39; You goys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!&#39;,
 &#39;I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.&#39;,
 &#34;So, guess what they&#39;re gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;ll never guess.&#34;,
 &#39;Guess.&#39;,
 &#39;You ready?  Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they\&#39;re gonna say,  &#34;Shit.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. I&#39;m gonna have people over to my house to see it.&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe you didn\&#39;t hear me, Kyle: I said &#34;shit!&#34; On television!&#39;,
 &#34;Jeez, you&#39;re a little irritable, Kyle. What&#39;s the matter? You got some sand &#34;
 &#39;in your vagina?&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, when are they gonna say &#34;shit&#34;?!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just holding it till the very last scene.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, we&#39;ve gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It&#39;s making you cranky. &#34;
 &#39;Does it itch?&#39;,
 &#34;Whoa, dude, it&#39;s raining frogs.&#34;,
 &#39; Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t get it.&#34;,
 &#39;Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t mind Kyle, everyone, he&#39;s just got a little sand in his vagina.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, they\&#39;ve taken all the fun out of &#34;shit.&#34; We\&#39;re gonna have to start &#39;
 &#39;saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. &#39;,
 &#39;You know, that stuff you get as a appetizer at Thai food restaurants. &#39;
 &#39;&#34;meecrob&#34; is way grosser than &#34;shit,&#34; dude. I\&#39;d scarf down a whole wet &#39;
 &#39;bucket fullof shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. &#39;,
 &#39; Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion &#39;
 &#39;King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.&#39;,
 &#39; Detective Sandy Vagina here thinks that &#34;shit&#34; might have something to do &#39;
 &#39;with everyone getting sick&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach &#39;
 &#39;and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This... could explain how Kyle got it in &#39;
 &#39;his vagina.&#39;,
 &#34;So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn&#39;t get released, you could &#34;
 &#39;become a walking time bomb. &#39;,
 &#39;Oho, gross!&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny&#39;s got it. heh heh.&#34;,
 &#34; Goddamnit, Kenny! Don&#39;t get your plague germs on me!&#34;,
 &#39;But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?&#39;,
 &#39;I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I &#39;
 &#39;do!&#39;,
 &#39;My house, too?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in its vagina! &#39;,
 &#39;What a stupid voice.&#39;,
 &#34; So please, everyone, From now on you&#39;ve got to try and watch your &#34;
 &#39;language. &#39;,
 &#39;Hah, I love you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not funny! Jesus Christ!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, he&#39;s excited.&#34;,
 &#39; Hey, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, and we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t call me an asshole, you sonofabitch.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t sound like that.&#34;,
 &#39;Cripple fight! &#39;,
 &#39;Awww!&#39;,
 &#39; Man, this guy sucks.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!&#39;,
 &#39;But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.&#39;,
 &#34; Beat it, toots! We&#39;ve got discrimination work to do! &#34;,
 &#39;Cripple fight!&#39;,
 &#39;CRIPPLE FIGHT!!! &#39;,
 &#39; Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight &#39;
 &#39;outside! &#39;,
 &#39;Eh, we kick ass.&#39;,
 &#34; Who&#39;s this asshole?&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, where&#39;d you guys get that ice cream?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!&#39;,
 &#39;When are we gonna learn magic tricks?&#39;,
 &#34;Then we get to be in David Blaine&#39;s secret club?&#34;,
 &#39;Cool.&#39;,
 &#39; Heheh, guess who I am, guys?&#39;,
 &#34;Uh it... doesn&#39;t matter, ma&#39;am. Blainetology is for everyone. There are &#34;
 &#39;Blainetologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a &#39;
 &#39;Goddamn Jew.&#39;,
 &#39; Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his &#39;
 &#34;television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we&#39;d like to share it &#34;
 &#39;with you.&#39;,
 &#39;Cool. &#39;,
 &#34;Ma&#39;am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine&#39;s plan is for you?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, you see, that, that&#39;s inteesting because... I&#39;m so thankful for David &#34;
 &#34;Blaine&#39;s book, and, I&#39;m so thankful that he showed me the way to true &#34;
 &#39;happiness but, I think about his plan often.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s going to eat his own head.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, come on, it&#39;ll make you a happy person.&#34;,
 &#34;No you&#39;re not.&#34;,
 &#34;No you&#39;re not.&#34;,
 &#34;No you&#39;re not.&#34;,
 &#34;No you&#39;re not.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten &#39;
 &#39;more audience members in order to get the prize.&#39;,
 &#39;Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. &#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s he doin&#39; here? &#34;,
 &#39;Now how the hell did he do that? &#39;,
 &#34; Did you hear that, guys? We&#39;re finally gonna die!&#34;,
 &#39; No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? &#39;,
 &#39; Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I know what you mean. I don&#39;t wanna die either.  I haven&#39;t even gotten &#34;
 &#39;my pubes yet.&#39;,
 &#39;That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: &#39;
 &#34;Why don&#39;t we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it &#34;
 &#39;in the morning.&#39;,
 &#39;I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.&#39;,
 &#39;This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all &#39;
 &#34;gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn&#39;t do iiit.&#34;,
 &#34;At least I&#39;m not the boy in the plastic bubble!&#34;,
 &#39;Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! &#39;,
 &#34; But it&#39;s the only way for us to be happy. &#34;,
 &#39; Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try agian. Hep .&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, I was just about to do it.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, that&#39;s so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out &#34;
 &#39;for a while? Heheheheheh &#39;,
 &#39; Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, bummer, dude.&#39;,
 &#34;Are you sure? I haven&#39;t seen it.&#34;,

 &#39;Aw, dude, gay!&#39;,
 &#39;Racist! &#39;,

 &#34;Kenny&#39;s a random slut. &#34;,
 &#39;Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! &#39;,
 &#39;Weak.&#39;,
 &#34;Look, if you don&#39;t come and do the show, I&#39;ll make you eat your parents!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.&#34;,
 &#34;Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn&#39;t LIED in the first place! &#34;
 &#39;You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright!&#39;,
 &#39; Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, it&#39;s 3:30! This is taking up my whole Saturday!&#34;,
 &#34;Why couldn&#39;t the funeral have been on a school day?&#34;,
 &#34; God! She didn&#39;t take this long to die!&#34;,
 &#39;Great! Now can we go?!&#39;,
 &#39;Ogh! God-damnit!!&#39;,
 &#39; Mom, I wanna go home!&#39;,
 &#39;Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh!&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!&#39;,
 &#39; Hoosajiggawha?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh yah sir, excuse me: Du- Does this mean that I... have... one... million &#39;
 &#39;dollars?&#39;,
 &#34;Nonowait, you don&#39;t understand:  since I was th-three years old it has been &#34;
 &#39;my dream to have one million dollars&#39;,
 &#39;Egh. &#39;,
 &#39; Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint &#39;
 &#39;green from its surface.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I&#39;m spending it.&#34;,
 &#34;On my dream.  On the one thing that I&#39;ve wanted ever since I could &#34;
 &#39;remember...&#39;,
 &#34;Nuh uh, I&#39;m spendin&#39; it.&#34;,
 &#39;Huh, I think God has plenty of money.&#39;,
 &#39;Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. &#39;,
 &#39;Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.&#39;,
 &#39;HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloadeers are gonna &#39;
 &#39;take my hard-earned cash!&#39;,
 &#34;Didn&#39;t earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! &#34;
 &#39;All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin &#39;
 &#34;and pee?! Don&#39;t tell me I didn&#39;t earn it, you son of a bitch!&#34;,
 &#34;My own amusement park, Mother. I&#39;m sure.&#34;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, but I&#39;m not buying the park to get people to come.&#34;,
 &#34;No no no! I&#39;m buying it to keep people out!  Don&#39;t you see? Forever it has &#34;
 &#39;been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in &#39;
 &#39;it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you &#39;
 &#39;go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, &#39;
 &#34;LINES!  If there&#39;s one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  &#34;
 &#39;And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then &#39;
 &#34;there&#39;s lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in &#34;
 &#34;line later. Then there&#39;s lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , &#34;
 &#39;lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this &#39;
 &#39;park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.&#39;,

 &#34; That&#39;s right! You stay out!&#34;,
 &#39;...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to &#39;
 &#39;get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, &#39;
 &#39;you are to shoot on sight!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return &#39;
 &#34;for you working security, I&#39;ll let you ride two rides a day. But only two &#34;
 &#34;rides, and only if I&#39;m not on them.&#34;,
 &#34; But, you can ride anything you want. And you don&#39;t have to wait in line.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.&#39;,
 &#34;But I don&#39;t have any cash. I spent everything on this park.&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh. Two people?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I&#39;ll open the park to two people each day! But &#34;
 &#39;remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet.&#39;,
 &#39; Alrightalright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two &#39;
 &#39;people each day. &#39;,
 &#39;I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.&#39;,
 &#39;The rest of you will just have to try another day.&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five &#34;
 &#39;cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.&#39;,
 &#39;...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I &#39;
 &#34;can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I&#39;ve got my own theme park. Hm, &#34;
 &#34;what should I go on now? I know! I&#39;ll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  &#34;
 &#39;Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?&#39;,
 &#34;Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can&#39;t you go on something else right now? &#34;,
 &#39;Ugh, alrightalright, hang on.  Security!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix &#39;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#34;But I don&#39;t know how it works.&#34;,
 &#34;Ogh, alrightalright! I&#39;ll let two more people in each day so I can hire a &#34;
 &#39;maintenance person.&#39;,
 &#34; Alright folks, we&#39;ve had another change in policy. I&#39;ve had to hire a &#34;
 &#39;maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a &#39;
 &#39;day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks &#39;
 &#34;inside the park, so now I&#39;ve had to hire a beverage person, and a &#34;
 &#39;cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a &#39;
 &#39;day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! &#39;
 &#34;Understood?  Alright, let&#39;s go. &#34;,
 &#39; Wait a minute! Who are you?&#39;,
 &#39;HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!&#39;,
 &#39;I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!&#39;,
 &#39;Get him out of here! &#39;,
 &#39;Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh &#39;
 &#34;man, I&#39;m so scared!  AAAAaaaa....&#34;,
 &#39; ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to &#39;
 &#39;let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the &#39;
 &#34;new ticket guy&#39;s salary, so that&#39;s three more admissions a day...  Cleanup &#34;
 &#34;crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that&#39;s about &#34;
 &#39;four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight &#39;
 &#39;hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! &#39;,
 &#39; Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! &#39;,
 &#39;AGH!  DAAAAAAH!!&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, there you are! &#39;,
 &#39;Just give me my money back.&#39;,
 &#34;I changed my mind! I don&#39;t want your stupid park!&#34;,
 &#39;You call this great?! I call it Hell! Trade me back, Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#39;GODDAMNIT GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! &#39;,
 &#39;Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! &#39;,
 &#39; Yeah?&#39;,
 &#34;He- Hey, that&#39;s my money!&#34;,
 &#39;What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeh- You can&#39;t take my money, Goddamnit!&#34;,
 &#34;No! But I don&#39;t... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Foon, I changed my mind. I need &#34;
 &#39;the park to make my money back.&#39;,
 &#34;But I&#39;m getting sued now. If I don&#39;t have the park I lose everything!&#34;,
 &#34;This can&#39;t be happening! AAAAAHH!!&#34;,
 &#34;It isn&#39;t fair!  You Goddamned assholes, it isn&#39;t fair! &#34;,
 &#34;You just build me up to chop me down, didn&#39;t you?! What about my dream?! &#34;
 &#39;What about my money?! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;M SO PISSED OFF! &#34;,
 &#39;Ey! You used to work for me!  Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonfofabitch! &#39;,
 &#39;Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!&#39;,

 &#39;rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh&#39;,
 &#39;I told you guys.&#39;,
 &#34; Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn&#39;t work if &#34;
 &#39;you beat off the dog again right away.&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s what it&#39;s called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don&#39;t you &#34;
 &#39;guys know anything?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it-hey &#39;
 &#39;come here, dog. Dog, come here! &#39;,
 &#39;AIDS?&#39;,
 &#34;Mr. Mackey didn&#39;t say nothin&#39; about that.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!&#39;,
 &#39;Just put it on, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?&#39;,
 &#34;I wasn&#39;t looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!&#34;,
 &#39;Do you feel protected?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.&#34;,
 &#34;So I don&#39;t get AIDS.&#34;,
 &#39;I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!&#39;,
 &#39;Here, talk to them, Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won&#39;t have to resort &#34;
 &#39;to violence.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, bitch!&#39;,
 &#34;Ew, Butters? You&#39;re in big trouble now.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I guess now that that&#39;s out of the way, we can get on with our lives. &#34;
 &#34;Come here, boy!  That&#39;s it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, &#34;

 &#34;Hey, this is all of ours. I&#39;m the one who found Stan&#39;s aborted brother in &#34;
 &#39;the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. &#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.&#39;,

 &#39;Hooray!&#39;,
 &#39;You are the worst character ever, Towelie.&#39;,

 &#39;God-damnit! &#39;,
 &#34;HA! I&#39;m not giving a dollar to those towelheads!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, but I though we were at war with these assholes!&#34;,
 &#39;That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just &#39;
 &#34;get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn&#39;t our fault that &#34;
 &#34;terrorists hate us. We&#39;re just kids. We&#39;re not the ones bombing them now, &#34;
 &#34;we&#39;re- we&#39;re jsut kids.  There&#39;s a lot of crazy stuff goin&#39; on in the world, &#34;
 &#34;but, we&#39;re caught in the middle. It&#39;s not our fault.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes, but they&#39;re sand monkeys!&#34;,
 &#39; God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I guess we&#39;re gonna have to kill it.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s an Afghanistan goat, so it can&#39;t stay here, or else it&#39;ll choke on the &#34;
 &#39;sweet air of freedom.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no, not Towelie.&#39;,
 &#34; No, we don&#39;t wanna get high!!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#34; Stan, if you&#39;re finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we&#39;d &#34;
 &#39;like to go now, please?&#39;,
 &#39; Aw, son of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#39; Uh ho, you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;It didn&#39;t smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.&#34;,
 &#39;Uh, whatever!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry! Next time I&#39;ll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn&#39;t mind &#34;
 &#39;staying tucked away for a while!&#39;,
 &#39;God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!&#39;,
 &#34;What is this? The freakin&#39; Flintstones?&#34;,
 &#39;It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back &#39;
 &#39;to your crappy country. &#39;,
 &#39;What did you call us?!&#39;,
 &#39;I told you! Jawas have no heart.&#39;,
 &#39;You know, sand people.&#39;,
 &#39; God, I hate you so much, Stan!&#39;,
 &#34;Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I&#39;m not a god-damned Canadian, &#34;
 &#39;and neither are you!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, don&#39;t call me a Canadian! &#34;,
 &#39;Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an &#39;
 &#34;oversensitive animal lover. He&#39;s got a boner for this goat, a-&#34;,
 &#34; Ogh! Dude, it&#39;s called deodorant, okay? It&#39;s not expensive.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna go take care of this prick!&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not crazy, he&#39;s an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. &#34;,
 &#34;Mehah...  What&#39;s up, bin Laden?&#34;,
 &#34;Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m&#39;heh&#34;,

 &#39;Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think &#39;
 &#34;it&#39;s their kid. &#34;,
 &#39;No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like &#39;
 &#39;they have butts where their heads should be! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh yes! And the best part is... they&#39;re coming here, to my house. And it&#39;s &#34;

 &#39; Oh my... God. &#39;,
 &#34;You guys, something&#39;s wrong.&#34;,
 &#34;I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I&#39;ll ever see. And I... &#34;
 &#39;think... I... blew a funny fuse.&#39;,
 &#34; It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don&#39;t think &#34;
 &#39;anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins &#39;
 &#39;your sense of humor forever?&#39;,
 &#34;Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can&#39;t laugh at &#34;
 &#39;anything.&#39;,
 &#39;You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone &#39;
 &#39;die... This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a &#39;
 &#34;car poicture and... I couldn&#39;t laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I &#34;
 &#34;couldn&#39;t laugh.&#34;,
 &#34; So does that mean I&#39;ll never laugh again?&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, dude, oh.&#39;,
 &#34;Nothing&#39;s wrong with me. Uh-&#34;,
 &#39;Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! &#39;,
 &#34;Jimmy, you&#39;ve always been my favorite standup comic. You&#39;ve gotta help me. &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ve lost my sense of humor.&#34;,
 &#39;I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, let me have it.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, why?&#39;,
 &#34;...Naw, see? Somethng&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m not laughing.&#34;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;,
 &#39;Orange who?&#39;,
 &#34; ...naw, that didn&#39;t work either.&#34;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;,
 &#39;An interrupting cow who&#39;,
 &#39;Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without &#39;
 &#34;laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can&#39;t go out to face it &#34;
 &#34;anymore. Please tell everyone why I won&#39;t be at school.&#34;,
 &#34;And please buy me more chocolate guns. I&#39;m starting to run out.&#34;,
 &#34;Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don&#39;t like the peanut-butter &#34;
 &#39;filled one.Eric.&#39;,
 &#34; What&#39;s goin&#39; on?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I guess now we&#39;ll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s funny.&#34;,
 &#34;Hehey, you&#39;re right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! &#34;,
 &#39;A-heh, what?&#39;,
 &#39;E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.&#39;,
 &#34; Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I&#39;m gonna go home and eat &#34;
 &#39;another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! &#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that thing?&#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Forty bucks?&#39;,
 &#39;Alrigh, alright.&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, Jesus, why don&#39;t you just cut off my balls?&#34;,
 &#34; Cold be tough. But I&#39;ll give it a shot.&#34;,
 &#39; ...Oh, man.&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, it&#39;s nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you&#39;re a relative of &#34;
 &#39;my good friend Kyle here. &#39;,
 &#34; Ohmigod, I&#39;m not gonna make it. I&#39;m not gonna make it.&#34;,
 &#39; I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!&#39;,
 &#39;Ugh, ugh!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh!&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe we&#39;ll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, &#34;
 &#39;damnit!&#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were &#39;
 &#39;sent to concentration camps.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, and see, I didn&#39;t realize that. But I understand now how you might&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.&#39;,
 &#34;No, I&#39;m seriously! Becuase, um, I was, I was talkin&#39; to Craig, and Craig was &#34;
 &#39;all like, &#34;Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD &#39;
 &#39;concentration camps?&#34; And I was all like, &#34;No way!&#34; And this little light &#39;
 &#39;went on in my head like, &#34;Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the &#39;
 &#39;class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin.&#34; But, but I was literally &#39;
 &#34;talkin&#39; about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to &#34;
 &#39;learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? &#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, give me another chance!&#39;,
 &#39;Haha,  serves you right, asshole. &#39;,
 &#34; He&#39;s faaahn.&#34;,
 &#39; 1, 2, 3, 4...&#39;,
 &#34; He&#39;s faaahn.&#34;,
 &#39;Heheheheheh. &#39;,
 &#34; I I, I learned that... you shouldn&#39;t judge somebody because... that-no, &#34;
 &#39;wait.&#39;,
 &#39; ...Good job, Jew!&#39;,
 &#39; Stand by, please.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, God-damnit!&#39;,
 &#39;Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In &#39;
 &#39;this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh GOD-DAMNIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;ll make you eat your parents!&#34;,
 &#39;Nothing! &#39;,
 &#39;Aw, that is such bullcrap!&#39;,
 &#39;No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus &#39;
 &#39;check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because &#39;
 &#39;his family is rich!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch &#39;
 &#39;boxes?!&#39;,
 &#34; Let&#39;s just see where Token&#39;s clothes come from, shall we?  Ooooo, Armani &#34;
 &#39;Exchange!&#39;,
 &#39;All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been &#39;
 &#34;inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn&#39;t think so! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million &#39;
 &#39;dollars.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.&#39;,
 &#34;Not too expensive for Token&#39;s rich ass family, apparently. &#34;,
 &#39; Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain &#39;
 &#39;Kirk can decrypt it. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, Jesus, dude. &#39;,
 &#39;What in the hell are they doing?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, let&#39;s just play our game, then.&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll start. I&#39;ll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! &#34;,
 &#39;Kick his nutsack! &#39;,
 &#39;Uh huh.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey!&#39;,

 &#34; It&#39;s been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What &#34;

 &#39;So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting &#39;
 &#39;away? Ihin other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, &#39;
 &#39;the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey&#39;s Pizza, they &#34;
 &#34;would become another Shakey&#39;s Pizza! And you&#39;d have your own Shakey&#39;s Pizza &#34;
 &#34;where you didn&#39;t have to charge yourself to eat!&#34;,
 &#39;Hmmm.&#39;,
 &#34;Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government&#39;s mind. &#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, &#34;
 &#34;doctor. I&#39;m gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. &#39;,
 &#39;My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole &#39;
 &#34;world is Kenny McCormick and he, he&#39;s sick right now. He&#39;s real sick. He&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;only eight years old and his doctors don&#39;t think he has very long to live. &#34;
 &#39;Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a &#39;
 &#34;touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there&#39;s a chance, a... chance &#34;
 &#34;that stem-cell research could save my best friend&#39;s life, well... I guess I &#34;
 &#39;owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  &#39;
 &#34;I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I&#39;m not the best speaker in the &#34;
 &#39;world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song  It was the &#39;
 &#39;heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant The heat of the moment &#39;
 &#39;shone in your eyes I never meant to be so bad to you One thing I said that I &#39;
 &#39;would never do&#39;,
 &#39;And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we &#39;
 &#39;can sell your fetus to compnaies like Alder Labs.&#39;,
 &#39;Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.&#39;,
 &#34; Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin&#39; an abortion today?  &#34;
 &#34;Great.  Listen, if you&#39;d like to sell your abortion for research I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your &#39;
 &#34;medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma&#39;am. Can I &#34;
 &#39;interest you in selling your aborted fetus? &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry to hear that, because uh, there&#39;s a little boy dying in a &#34;
 &#39;hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The &#39;
 &#39;stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys! Come quick! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s...  Why, it&#39;s a miracle, you guys! &#34;,
 &#34;Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey&#39;s, &#34;
 &#34;and they ARE replicating a new Shakey&#39;s!  It worked! &#34;,
 &#34;Stupid fetuses? It&#39;s my own Shakey&#39;s!&#34;,
 &#39;I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish &#39;
 &#39;up the kitchen.&#39;,
 &#39;Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Huho!&#39;,

 &#39; Shu- shut up you gurs, shut up you guys. &#39;,
 &#39; Hello, is this City Wok?&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, yes, we&#39;d like one order of the City Beef.&#34;,
 &#39; Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is sooo cool.&#39;,
 &#39;Eh, AIDS?&#39;,
 &#34;Ohmigod!  You guys! I think I&#39;m having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming &#34;
 &#39;to me now.&#39;,
 &#34;Noo. Don&#39;t you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with &#39;
 &#34;them? Say they&#39;ll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a &#34;
 &#39;little tiny bit of it and exercise.&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s right Stan.  It&#39;s a cash cow I tell you.&#34;,
 &#39;Lose weight and make money. I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing &#39;
 &#39;that Butters has ever done.&#39;,
 &#34;Weh- who do you think I&#39;m talkin&#39; about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?&#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t lose weight, Butters, &#39;cause I&#39;m not fat. I&#39;m big-boned. You can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;slim down bones, stupid!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with &#34;
 &#39;City Wok, then take the weight back off.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh come on! Just think about how famous you&#39;ll be!&#34;,
 &#39;He used to be fat but not no more &#39;,
 &#39; and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.&#39;,
 &#39;Uuh, school project.&#39;,
 &#34;Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I&#39;ll kick you till you&#39;re deader than Kenny!&#34;,
 &#39;So how long until we can joke about it?&#39;,
 &#34;Woogh, that&#39;s a long time to wait.&#34;,
 &#39;Then eat your puke.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh come on! Japanese girls do it. &#39;,
 &#39;Get a hold of yourself, man!&#39;,
 &#39;Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.&#39;,
 &#39; The fat one!&#39;,
 &#39;Just like Jared.&#39;,
 &#39;Sir, we are in business!&#39;,
 &#39; Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk &#39;
 &#39;of crap!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got &#39;
 &#34;seven chins, boah!! You&#39;ll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!!&#34;,
 &#34; Butters, I&#39;m just trying to offer some motivational help here.&#34;,
 &#34; ROW you fat bitch!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Nobody loves you!! You&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;not even a person!!&#39;,
 &#39; Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they&#39;re not gonna want him &#34;
 &#34;to just make one commercial, they&#39;re gonna want several.&#34;,
 &#34;I think we&#39;re looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. &#34;
 &#39;My calculations put that at about four million dollars.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, &#39;
 &#39;except that I should get a twenty percent pernegation fee off the gross for &#39;
 &#39;having come up with the idea.&#39;,
 &#34;Well we&#39;re supposed to shoot yoru commercial today, you fat piece of crap!&#34;,
 &#34;No it isn&#39;t, stupid blubberbutt!!&#34;,
 &#39;Check.&#39;,
 &#39;That should blah  ah here. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh stop your bitchin&#39; Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!&#34;,
 &#39;Alrighty.&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, I think it&#39;s in. &#34;,
 &#39; Bohogh, egh. &#39;,
 &#39;There it goes.&#39;,
 &#39; Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff &#39;
 &#39;that Chef makes sometimes.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh yeah, keep doing that. That&#39;s working good.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, whoa. Whoa! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, crap!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see &#39;
 &#39;how skinny you are!&#39;,
 &#39;Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up &#39;

 &#34;Alright I&#39;d better get out of here before they get back. &#34;,
 &#39;Butters, it was my pleasure. &#39;,

 &#39;You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and &#39;
 &#39;then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? &#39;
 &#34;You&#39;ve never Hitlered anyone?&#34;,
 &#39;Shh-shh, here he comes.&#39;,

 &#39;and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. &#39;,
 &#39; You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk &#39;
 &#39;play-action headset.&#39;,
 &#34;Stan, could you hurry it up? I&#39;m freezing my ass off.&#34;,
 &#39;O! At least I have as ass, Jew!&#39;,
 &#39;See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of &#34;
 &#39;blood.&#39;,
 &#39;Eh! &#39;,
 &#34;Check it out, you guys. I&#39;m calf-curling. &#34;,

 &#34;Butters, I&#39;m going to kill you over and over again.&#34;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t go on. Need... food...&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s only one alternative, you guys. We&#39;re gonna have to eat a calf.&#34;,
 &#34;All right. Then we&#39;re gonna have to eat Butters. &#34;,
 &#39;Food!&#39;,
 &#39;Look you guys! Beef jerky!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, if you don&#39;t eat meat at all, you become a pussy.&#34;,
 &#34;Go ahead, that&#39;s more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who&#39;s &#34;

 &#39;Hippies!&#39;,
 &#39;What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now &#39;
 &#34;we&#39;re no-good dirty God-damned hippies!&#34;,
 &#39; Dah, give me that!  Talk to me Mike.&#39;,
 &#39;Sure, sure.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you have in mind?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Mike, you&#39;re breakin&#39; my balls here, Mike.&#34;,
 &#34;All right, how &#39;bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have &#34;
 &#39;nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -&#39;,
 &#34; We&#39;ll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our &#34;
 &#39;own.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I thought we were talkin&#39; here, but I guess you&#39;re not &#34;
 &#34;talkin&#39; to me. Goodbye.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t have a dad, Mike. That&#39;s not gonna work.&#34;,
 &#39; Hello.&#39;,
 &#34;All right, we&#39;ll keep ours. We&#39;ll send out one calf. &#34;,
 &#34;Oh, Jesus! You know, there&#39;s just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! &#34;,
 &#34;We had a deal! Do you think I&#39;m stupid?! Don&#39;t treat me like I&#39;m stupid &#34;
 &#39;here! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh nonono, now you&#39;re gonna have to get us something else! &#34;,
 &#39;Mike, speak.&#39;,
 &#39;We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?&#39;,
 &#39;Good, good.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Mike, breakin&#39; my balls, Mike.&#34;,
 &#39;And Worf?&#39;,
 &#39;Step back! Tell those men to step back!&#39;,
 &#34; Aw, shut up, you freakin&#39; hippies!  Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and &#34;
 &#39;put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as &#34;Captain.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;No. See, must say, &#34;Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely &#34;
 &#39;load in the calves.&#39;,
 &#39; &#34;Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, all set!&#39;,
 &#39;Step on it, Mr. Worf! &#39;,
 &#34;Wait a minute. They&#39;re following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!&#34;,
 &#39; &#34;Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance &#39;
 &#39;from those police cruisers.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, it&#39;s a double-cross!!&#34;,
 &#39;What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!&#39;,
 &#39;Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank God we stopped it in time.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll do it.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, could you take a seat, please?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you&#39;ve really &#34;
 &#39;stepped up as a friend and &#34;filled the gap.&#34; &#39;,
 &#34;Yes. Well, Butters, it&#39;s just not working out.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You&#39;re just &#34;
 &#39;tooo...&#39;,
 &#39;Lane, yes.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, well, we weren&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#39; But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, &#39;
 &#39;right? &#39;,
 &#39;Who cares?&#39;,
 &#39; All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout.  &#39;
 &#39;Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still &#39;
 &#34;looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you&#39;ve all been selected as &#34;
 &#39;possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. &#39;
 &#39;So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with &#39;
 &#34;each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we&#39;ve found &#34;
 &#39;the perfect friend. Are there any questions?&#39;,
 &#39;Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down &#39;
 &#39;from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the &#39;
 &#39;amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that &#39;
 &#39;this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the &#39;
 &#39;best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance &#39;
 &#39;fee.&#39;,
 &#39; I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. &#39;,
 &#34;...Yeah, I&#39;ve only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;more like a prop. &#39;,
 &#39;We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  &#39;
 &#34;The great thing was that, because Jimmy&#39;s crippled, we got to go to the &#34;
 &#39;front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, &#39;
 &#39;but then we got to the ride itself, and...&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, really?  That&#39;s gonna cost some points. &#34;,
 &#39;All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you &#39;
 &#39;all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you &#39;
 &#34;receive a rose, please stay. If you don&#39;t, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will &#34;
 &#39;you announce the people we want to stay?&#39;,
 &#39;Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! &#39;,
 &#39;Next?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, so now we&#39;re gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. &#34;
 &#39;Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give &#39;
 &#39;us answers. So good luck, everybody.&#39;,
 &#39;Alrighty then. &#39;,
 &#34;Uh, what&#39;s the question again?&#34;,
 &#39;Five times one is of course...&#39;,
 &#39;Five. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! Well, you&#39;re a stupid Jew!&#34;,
 &#39; Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you &#39;
 &#39;very much. &#39;,
 &#39;All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from &#39;
 &#34;ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn&#39;t pick &#34;
 &#39;were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Just one mroe rose, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent &#39;
 &#39;competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! &#39;,
 &#39;Ooooooo, somebody\&#39;s a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, &#34;get the fudge &#39;
 &#39;out!&#34; Which means, kiss mah fudgin\&#39; ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get &#39;
 &#39;the fudge out, Clyde!&#39;,
 &#39; The swinsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the &#39;
 &#39;candidates. &#39;,
 &#39;Next please.&#39;,
 &#39;If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?&#39;,
 &#39;Very nice. &#39;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!&#34;,
 &#39;All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! &#39;,
 &#34;Hey, what&#39;s wrong with the Jumbotron?&#34;,
 &#39;I think Towelie is awesome.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.&#39;,
 &#34;Token&#39;s a smartass.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah. Do we really need another one?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, thanks Jimmy&#39;,
 &#39;Alright Jimmy, see ya. &#39;,
 &#39;Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we &#39;
 &#39;will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. &#39;,
 &#39;Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the &#39;
 &#39;rose go to? &#39;,
 &#34; You guys, you guys! You&#39;re not gonna believe it! &#34;,
 &#34;Everything&#39;s gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn&#39;t so crappy after all!&#34;,
 &#39;No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean &#39;
 &#39;creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!&#39;,
 &#39;Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, &#39;
 &#39;build castles and play basketball and stuff.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.&#39;,
 &#34; Okay, Kyle, you&#39;re being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want &#34;
 &#39;everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to &#39;
 &#39;all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tonorrow!&#39;,
 &#39;Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...&#39;,
 &#34; Look at me, livin&#39; free Free and clean amongst the Sea People  We look for &#34;
 &#39;pirates and search for gold. Life is an adventure with the Sea People  They &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t ever conplain, they don&#39;t call me fat. They don&#39;t make me do homework &#34;
 &#34;or nothin&#39; like that.  This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin&#39; and &#34;
 &#39;singing,  Sea people and me. Sea people and me, you guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can &#39;
 &#39;take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. &#39;,
 &#34;Okay. I&#39;ve added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. &#34;
 &#39;Now it says  &#34;Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see &#39;
 &#39;sea life spring instantly.&#34;  Okay, let\&#39;s just run through this one more &#39;
 &#39;time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as &#39;
 &#34;Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we&#39;ll all &#34;
 &#34;engage them in simple conversation. We&#39;ve gotta make sea people feel &#34;
 &#39;comfortable, okay? Ready?&#39;,
 &#39; Hold the sign up, Kyle!  Higher, Kyle!  Okay.  Here we go. &#39;,
 &#39;What the fuck is this?! &#39;,
 &#39;I got RIPPED OFF! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why &#39;
 &#34;there&#39;s war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don&#39;t you learn to &#34;
 &#34;button your shirt right, for once?! You&#39;re as bad as Stan with his stupid &#34;
 &#39;girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They &#39;
 &#39;were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were &#39;
 &#39;supposed to take me on adventures of the deep&#39;,
 &#34; Who cares?! Throw &#39;em away!!&#34;,
 &#39; Heheh, okay, okay.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!&#39;,
 &#39; Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!&#39;,
 &#39;Tweek! Where are you going?&#39;,
 &#39;In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take &#39;
 &#39;the fall on this one.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve only got one option, you guys. We&#39;re gonna have to go to that hospital &#34;
 &#34;where they&#39;re doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.&#34;,
 &#39;Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door &#39;
 &#39;and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: &#39;
 &#39;Hammertime.&#39;,
 &#39; Ugh.  Just remember the song &#34;Can\&#39;t Touch This&#34; and you\&#39;ll remember the &#39;
 &#39;code word!&#39;,
 &#39;Is it her?&#39;,
 &#39;Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You &#39;
 &#39;guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...&#39;,
 &#39;No, just a bunch of goo.&#39;,
 &#39;There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and &#39;
 &#39;nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. &#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher&#39;s stomach.and &#34;
 &#39;we put them back in their aquarium!&#39;,
 &#34;Well if they found somebody else&#39;s sea men in her stomach, maybe they&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;find our sea people, too.&#39;,
 &#34;G&#39;night, guys.&#34;,
 &#39; Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. &#39;,
 &#34; H&#39;you guys! Come quick!  You won&#39;t believe it!&#34;,
 &#34;Those sea men from the teacher&#39;s stomach somehow combined with the remaining &#34;
 &#39;sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve been up for hours doing some calculations, and I&#39;ve come up with my &#34;
 &#39;final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea &#39;
 &#39;ciety.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more &#34;
 &#39;of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!&#39;,
 &#39;You go and send away for mre sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least &#39;
 &#39;five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish &#39;
 &#39;tank to them all in.&#39;,
 &#34;Me?  I&#39;m gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?&#39;,
 &#39;Do you have them or not?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;,
 &#34;Frances, let&#39;s talk. I don&#39;t want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The &#39;
 &#34;truth is, I&#39;m completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may &#34;
 &#34;appear young, I&#39;m one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up &#34;
 &#34;and comer, you know what I&#39;m saying? I&#39;ll have my own business soon and I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#34;need people to run it. I&#39;m talkin&#39; about you, Frances. And I&#39;m talkin&#39; about &#34;
 &#39;a six-figure income. How does that sound? &#39;,
 &#39; I see, very interesting. &#39;,
 &#34;Takin&#39; a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, &#34;
 &#39;good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;ll take five.&#34;,
 &#39;No, gallons.&#39;,
 &#34;Damint! Give me all you&#39;ve got, then! &#34;,
 &#39; That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, &#39;
 &#39;Tweek?&#39;,
 &#34;And I&#39;ve got the sea men. &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from &#39;
 &#39;this guy Ralph in an alley.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn&#39;t even charge me &#34;
 &#39;money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  &#39;
 &#39;There we go. &#39;,
 &#34;Nothin&#39; to do now but wait.&#34;,
 &#39;Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  &#39;
 &#34;Look! There&#39;s a library! A-and a temple! And a- woh-?  Oh. They think I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the &#39;
 &#34;sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I&#39;m god &#34;
 &#39;of the sea people!&#39;,
 &#39; Ha ha! &#39;,
 &#39;Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric &#39;
 &#39;Cartman, god.&#39;,
 &#39;Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna send a message to my people and tell &#39;em to develop a great &#34;
 &#39;machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them &#39;
 &#39;forever.&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?&#39;,
 &#39; ...So?&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, that&#39;s great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.&#34;,
 &#34;That is bullcrap! You&#39;d better stop worshiping him, sea people! &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah! Go! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh God-damnit! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh no! Oh the humanity!&#39;,
 &#34;Why can&#39;t societies just live in peace?&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;,
 &#39;Ih... in our... butt?&#39;,
 &#39; Maybe... No.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, isn&#39;t that the damnedest thing?&#34;,
 &#39;Hm.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw, dude, I think I might have it.&#39;,
 &#39; It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you &#39;
 &#39;crap out yoru butt, right?&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, now keep working with me here, it&#39;s getting a little complicated. &#34;
 &#39;If you eat food and crap out yoru butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in &#39;
 &#39;your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?&#39;,
 &#34;What, that&#39;s not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the &#34;
 &#34;butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That&#39;s not dumb, that&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;genius.&#39;,
 &#39;Have you ever tried it?&#39;,
 &#34;I bet you twenty buck it&#39;ll work!&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, let&#39;s go, Jew! &#34;,
 &#39; Hold on!  God, let a man crap!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m doin&#39; it already!! God, give me a minute!&#34;,
 &#34; I can&#39;t-, I can&#39;t do it with you guys watching. Turn around.&#34;,
 &#34;Ugh! Do you really think I&#39;d be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddamnit &#34;
 &#39;you guys, this si so seriously. &#39;,
 &#39; Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  &#39;
 &#39;You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just that... I can&#39;t decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I &#34;
 &#39;was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two &#39;
 &#39;Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- &#39;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys! Look! &#39;,
 &#34;I went down to the bank and got Kyle&#39;s twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty &#34;
 &#39;single-dollar bills.&#39;,
 &#34;So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle&#39;s money! Mmmm, Kyle&#39;s money!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.&#39;,
 &#34;Gee Kyle, don&#39;t be a sore loser. It&#39;s over, okay? I won. Let it go.&#34;,
 &#34; That&#39;s stupid and immature, Cartman!&#34;,
 &#34; You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle&#39;s twenty dollars down to the bank again, &#34;
 &#39;and I got it changed into quarters!&#39;,
 &#39;So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  &#39;
 &#34;Yeessss. Kyle&#39;s monneey. &#34;,
 &#34;O-hoo, what&#39;s that, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;Heh...  what?&#39;,
 &#39; You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah, we want our money back!&#39;,
 &#39;You asshole! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then &#39;
 &#39;sells them back to the government for a profit.&#39;,
 &#39;Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny &#39;
 &#39;because we thought you were a team player!&#39;,
 &#34;Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we&#39;ll find someone to &#34;
 &#39;replace YOU!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody&#39;s gonna show up!&#34;,
 &#34;Look at it, dude. You&#39;re not offereing any fabulous prizes. You have to &#34;
 &#39;offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. &#39;
 &#39;Here. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.&#39;,
 &#39;Well we can just make them out of paper.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not hard, it&#39;s just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free &#34;
 &#34;stuff - don&#39;t you guys know anything?!&#34;,
 &#39; Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!&#39;,
 &#39;How many hats have you made?&#39;,
 &#39;We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!&#39;,
 &#34;Then I&#39;mo kick your ass, Tweek!&#34;,
 &#39; I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.&#39;,
 &#34; Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn&#39;t make enough of them.&#34;,
 &#39;But just remember that I do all the talking.&#39;,
 &#34;Because I&#39;m the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.&#34;,
 &#39;Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! &#39;,
 &#39;What could possibly go wrong?&#39;,
 &#39; ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. &#39;,
 &#34; Dude, that&#39;s Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re children.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.&#39;,
 &#39;Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders &#39;
 &#34;of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas&#39;s house. We need to &#34;
 &#39;find and usurp that negative.&#39;,
 &#39;He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?&#39;,
 &#34; Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You&#39;ve been our new friend now for &#34;
 &#34;two weeks, okay? And I&#39;ve gotta be honest with you, it isn&#39;t going well.&#34;,
 &#34;People aren&#39;t that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I &#34;
 &#34;say you&#39;ve got one last shot here, and I don&#39;t want you to blow it, okay? &#34;
 &#39;Does that help take the stress off?&#39;,
 &#39; Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! &#39;,
 &#39;Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!&#39;,
 &#39;Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, you asked for it. I&#39;m afraid you leave us no choice. It&#39;s time for &#34;
 &#39;Plan B.&#39;,
 &#34; You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we&#39;re goin&#39; tuh melt your &#34;
 &#39;icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? &#39;,
 &#34;Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there&#39;s a lots &#34;
 &#39;of-&#39;,
 &#39;...No, he has an icy heart.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a cool island song.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, do we wanna do that?&#39;,
 &#39;Wow.&#39;,
 &#39;AY!&#39;,
 &#39;Man, that new version must have sucked balls.&#39;,
 &#39;That and youth. Those guys are old.&#39;,
 &#34; Hello, Precious. Yes, that&#39;s a good Precious.  Now it takes the lotion from &#34;
 &#39;the basket.&#39;,
 &#39;It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, that&#39;s a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the &#34;
 &#39;basket.&#39;,
 &#39;It puts the lotion back in the basket!&#39;,
 &#34; Put the lotion in the fuckin&#39; basket!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes Mom?&#39;,
 &#34; ...No, our teacher&#39;s dead. Remember?&#34;,
 &#34; Two weeks isn&#39;t enough. I&#39;m not over our teacher&#39;s tragic death. I&#39;m still &#34;
 &#39;sh-shooken up.&#39;,
 &#39; But I wanna plaaayyy.&#39;,
 &#34;Mr. Mackey, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m over the teacher&#39;s tragic death yet. I need &#34;
 &#34;more time. It&#39;s just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?&#39;,
 &#39;It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, may be.&#39;,
 &#39;Right, heh.&#39;,
 &#39;Woohoo.&#39;,
 &#34;God, you know what, that&#39;s so true? Because, you sometimes never really &#34;
 &#34;think about how old a pet is until it&#39;s gone.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk&#39;,
 &#34; Alright guys, now that we&#39;re all here, I think... we need to have a &#34;
 &#34;difficult conversation. It&#39;s obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, &#34;
 &#34;smartest, most awesome person we&#39;ve ever met.&#34;,
 &#34;And, you know, we&#39;ve been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever &#34;
 &#34;since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn&#39;t been an easy process.&#34;,
 &#34;And so, even though I think it&#39;s a tough thing to do right now, I think &#34;
 &#34;maybe it&#39;s best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new &#34;
 &#39;fourth friend.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;been really great, and we&#39;re gonna miss you.&#34;,
 &#34;And even though it didn&#39;t quite work out, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find other friends &#34;
 &#34;down the road, Kyle. Here&#39;s a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. &#34;,
 &#34;And we&#39;re really sad to see you go. Let&#39;s give a big round of applause for &#34;
 &#39;Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.&#39;,
 &#39;Pleeeeease???&#39;,
 &#39; Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, &#39;
 &#34;Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here&#39;s a watch, and &#34;
 &#39;some peanuts. &#39;,
 &#39;Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s fine! That&#39;s fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, &#34;
 &#34;Tweek!  Bebe, you&#39;re still cool. &#34;,
 &#39; And this is Precious.&#39;,
 &#34; Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom&#39;s hand lotion in this little &#34;
 &#39;basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. &#39;,
 &#39;Now you say, &#34;It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose &#39;
 &#39;again.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Heheh, yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Now say it again, louder.&#39;,
 &#39;Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!&#39;,
 &#39;Now, just yell &#34;Put the lotion in the fucking basket!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I&#39;ve got your dog, &#34;
 &#39;Mister. Let me out or I\&#39;m gonna kill it!  Now you say, &#34;Don\&#39;t you hurt my &#39;
 &#39;fuckin\&#39; dog!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;You bitch, I&#39;ll cut your throat if- &#34;,
 &#39;We\&#39;re playing &#34;Lambs.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Bebe&#39;s boobs?&#34;,
 &#39;So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?&#39;,
 &#39;What a stupid bitch! &#39;,
 &#39; One please.&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, relax.&#39;,
 &#39;Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?&#39;,
 &#39;So weak. So weak, dude. Man.&#39;,
 &#34;At least I&#39;m not a stupid Jew.&#34;,
 &#39;Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.&#39;,
 &#39;You bet your fat clown ass it is!&#39;,
 &#39; ...ticket stub?&#39;,
 &#39;Wu-we don\&#39;t &#34;really&#34; need the ticket stub, do we?&#39;,
 &#39; GODDAMNIT!!!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys we&#39;ve got to focus! We&#39;ve got to focus, and remember. &#34;,
 &#34; Nah, I&#39;ll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39; Kenny!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!&#39;,
 &#39; What the fuck is closure?!&#39;,
 &#39;You turned him into a teapot?&#39;,
 &#39;Wewewewewewe...&#39;,
 &#34;Hold on, I&#39;m checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...&#34;,
 &#39;...Kenny?  Kenny?!&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!&#39;,
 &#34;God-damnit! This isn&#39;t even GOOD chocolate milk mix!&#34;,
 &#34;Egh, because they&#39;re poor, Kyle! Poor people don&#39;t have anything better to &#34;
 &#34;do than piss other people off! Don&#39;t you watch Springer?!&#34;,
 &#39;Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. &#39;,
 &#34; Huh! ... I don&#39;t think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. &#34;,
 &#34; What what?  Jesus, you buttholes! It&#39;s six in the morning!&#34;,
 &#39;How?&#39;,
 &#34;I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison&#39;s car. &#34;,
 &#39;...No.  Ey! Euuugh.&#39;,
 &#39; Wha-uh, what?? What?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like my brain just keeps... jacking off.&#34;,
 &#39;Do you think?&#39;,
 &#39;Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34; Aw, don&#39;t tell me we haven&#39;t even reached the cloud city yet!&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, look. I didn&#39;t wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we&#39;re not &#34;
 &#34;seeing heaven because one of us doesn&#39;t believe in it enough.&#34;,
 &#39;Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see &#39;
 &#39;them if you really believe in them.&#39;,
 &#34;You know, maybe we&#39;re not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.&#34;,
 &#34;Because Jews don&#39;t believe in heaven!&#34;,
 &#39;Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup &#39;
 &#34;at Barney&#39;s Beanery by lying about a hair in it.&#34;,
 &#39;AH! &#39;,
 &#39;In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He was born where hungry children cry, &#39;
 &#34;kickin&#39;, his whole family resides in the ghetto, in the ghetto&#34;,
 &#39;What did you say?!&#39;,
 &#39;What did you say?!&#39;,
 &#39; I said &#34;Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!&#34;  Did I just call &#39;
 &#39;myself a blood-belching vagina?&#39;,
 &#34;I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I&#39;m Kenny. Seeing memories through his &#34;
 &#39;eyes.&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re a- stupid Jew.&#34;,
 &#39; Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty &#39;
 &#39;litter.&#39;,
 &#39; Shut up!&#39;,
 &#39; Shut up!&#39;,
 &#34;That explains it. Why I&#39;m having Kenny&#39;s memories all the time. His soul is &#34;
 &#39;inside me.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living &#34;
 &#39;souls from your body.&#39;,
 &#34;Looks like I&#39;ve come to the right place.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, &#39;
 &#39;please.&#39;,
 &#39;Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and &#39;
 &#39;not put him up in a condominium! &#39;,
 &#34;Listen, lady! You&#39;ve got to get this crap out of me!  I don&#39;t want him in me &#34;
 &#39;anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!&#39;,
 &#39;Ey! &#39;,
 &#39;Kenny! Kenny!&#39;,
 &#34; Nah, I&#39;ll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;d better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I&#39;ll kick you in the nuts! &#34;
 &#39;The nuts! The nuts! &#39;,
 &#34;The ticket! Kenny didn&#39;t have it on him when he died! He put it away &#34;
 &#34;somewhere!  Don&#39;t you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my &#34;
 &#39;God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! &#39;,
 &#34;I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn&#39;t keep the ticket with &#34;
 &#39;him, he put it away somewhere.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I &#34;
 &#39;clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to &#39;
 &#39;wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! &#39;,
 &#39;Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! &#39;,
 &#39;Not by giving me brain damage!&#39;,
 &#39; Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...&#39;,
 &#39;...I\&#39;ve never heard the words &#34;only&#34; and &#34;candy&#34; in the same sentence &#39;
 &#39;before.&#39;,
 &#34; No no, I just drank his memories. I&#39;m not sharing my body with that poor &#34;
 &#39;piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.&#39;,
 &#39;Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! &#39;,
 &#39;Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie &#39;
 &#39;with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!&#39;,
 &#39;It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the &#34;
 &#34;dragon&#39;s fire. &#34;,
 &#39;And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, &#39;
 &#39;and the covetous Jew.&#39;,
 &#34;Jews can&#39;t be Paladins.&#34;,
 &#39;Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?&#39;,
 &#34;Man, that&#39;s crap.&#34;,
 &#39;And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.&#39;,
 &#39;Prepare for battle! &#39;,
 &#39;This sounds like a really important quest.&#39;,
 &#39;This... is so cool.&#39;,
 &#34;Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan&#39;s&#39;s house! &#34;,
 &#34;And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan&#39;s&#39;s house.&#34;,
 &#39;Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gay!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;The one tape must be returned!  Run! &#39;,
 &#39;I must say I agree. If this copy of the Lord of the Rings is tainted, it &#39;
 &#39;would not be safe in the wrong hands.&#39;,
 &#39; Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of &#39;
 &#39;Paragon.&#39;,
 &#39; Open.  Bellog. &#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.&#39;,
 &#34;Clyde&#39;s a dick.&#34;,
 &#39;Kevin, God-damnit! &#39;,
 &#39;Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. &#39;,
 &#39;My God, this thing must really be powerful. &#39;,
 &#39;Quiet!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re acting like a bunch of assholes!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman&#39;s body is big enough for the both of &#34;
 &#39;us.  Shut up, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!&#39;,
 &#39;Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that &#39;
 &#39;is the way of the-&#39;,
 &#39; HA!! Fags!! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes. He&#39;s been following us for like two hours. &#34;,
 &#34;Just ignore him - maybe he&#39;ll go away.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! &#34;,
 &#34;Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can&#39;t stand water!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed &#34;
 &#39;to WATER!&#39;,
 &#39;Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don&#39;t know where we are! &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s what lost means, stupid! Kenny, shut your Goddamned mouth!!&#34;,
 &#39;If that was possible.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re screwed.&#34;,
 &#39;The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as &#39;
 &#39;well.&#39;,
 &#39;And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.&#39;,
 &#39; Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.&#39;,
 &#39; No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?&#39;,
 &#34; Kenny, no! Don&#39;t do it, Kenny! &#34;,
 &#39;No, it was Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Ey!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw man, this is awesome! &#39;,
 &#39; I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!&#39;,
 &#39; Look, a covetous Jew!&#39;,
 &#39;Ey!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not fat, I have a different life choice.&#34;,
 &#39;Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll take three lunches today, please.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.&#39;,
 &#39;Nothing.&#39;,
 &#39; Yes sir!  Phew. &#39;,
 &#34; Hey, I was kidding. There&#39;s actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! &#34;,
 &#34; Kenny. Can&#39;t have Kenny.&#34;,
 &#39;Ey Kenny! God-damn you Kenny!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey you guys! How&#39;s it goin&#39;?&#34;,
 &#39; What the hell are you assholes doing here?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, about a month.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s gone again.&#34;,
 &#39; Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Thanks, asshole.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!&#39;,
 &#39;Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, good. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh for the love of Christ.  I wanna watch, fat boy!  No, Kenny, it&#39;s not &#34;
 &#39;funny!&#39;,
 &#39;Right now?&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh, Aahhhh! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey, ah I feel a lot better.&#39;,
 &#34;God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we&#39;d never get out of &#34;
 &#39;stinky-ass smelly Scotland!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s still in baggage claims!&#34;,
 &#39; Then you throw it away, smartass. &#39;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s this asshole?&#34;,
 &#39;Then how does he know our names?&#39;,
 &#39;Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?&#39;,
 &#39;That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!&#39;,
 &#34; Juvi Hall!  Stan&#39;s a loser! Stan&#39;s a loser! &#34;,
 &#39; Yes, come in, please. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn&#39;t know it was you guys.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o&#39;clock?&#34;,
 &#34;Eh, so, you don&#39;t want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating &#34;
 &#34;you, then?  Look, ah, I don&#39;t know what your parents did to you, but if &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at &#34;
 &#39;least ...hear what I have to offer?&#39;,
 &#39;That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from &#39;
 &#34;the ground up. I&#39;ve beenhelping children get back at their parents ever &#34;
 &#39;since.&#39;,
 &#34;Craig&#39;s. a-and Clyde&#39;s. Oh and and Kyle&#39;s, but that was a freebie. Look, I &#34;
 &#39;run a legitimate business hre with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and &#39;
 &#39;technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed &#39;
 &#39;off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. &#39;,
 &#39; God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?&#34;,
 &#34;Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that&#39;s consequences. They need to &#34;
 &#34;see consequences from their actions, or else they&#39;ll never learn. What my &#34;
 &#39;company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real &#39;
 &#39;and very direct way.&#39;,
 &#39;Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven &#39;
 &#39;easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, Butters, let&#39;s start with you. I thnk I&#39;ve found a great way to get &#34;
 &#34;revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I&#39;m going in the right direction &#34;
 &#34;here.  What we&#39;re going to do, Butters, is we&#39;re going to wait for your &#34;
 &#39;parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. &#39;,
 &#39;Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, &#39;
 &#39;tailored to your revenge on your parents.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown &#39;
 &#39;would go nicely with your house.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green &#39;
 &#39;in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn &#39;
 &#34;crunch in your parents&#39; bedroom.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, well let&#39;s do that then. That looks nice.&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, now, Stan. For you I&#39;ve put together a really nice design. I feel &#34;
 &#39;your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs &#39;
 &#34;to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents&#39; door, &#34;
 &#34;telling them I&#39;m the counselor from the school.&#34;,
 &#39;The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me &#39;
 &#39;right-away, back at my office.&#39;,
 &#39;Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no &#39;
 &#39;meeting is actually taking place.&#39;,
 &#34;And while they&#39;re gone, we&#39;re gonna smear all their walls with poop. &#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the &#39;
 &#39;poop swatches.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That&#39;s why we have &#34;
 &#39;these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh &#39;
 &#34;this is nice. How about this: uh, we&#39;ll lure your parents out of the house, &#34;
 &#34;and then we&#39;ll kill them. Uh, we&#39;ll cut them up into little pieces and feed &#34;
 &#39;them to the dog&#39;,
 &#34;Extreme enough for you? How&#39;s Wednesday?&#34;,
 &#34; Well first it&#39;s not extreme enough and then it&#39;s too extreme; where do you &#34;
 &#39;want it?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a professional, suh!  Don&#39;t worry about it, Butters. You&#39;re gonna be a &#34;
 &#39;hundred percent satisfied.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic &#39;
 &#34;brown poop is supposed to go in the parents&#39; bedroom! The living room is &#34;
 &#39;supposed to be all baby green poop!&#39;,
 &#39;¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba &#39;
 &#39;arriba!&#39;,
 &#39;Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the &#39;
 &#34;nut-n-corn crunch poop. That&#39;s why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? &#34;
 &#39;Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.&#39;,
 &#39;Marrado. Spectacularrr.&#39;,
 &#34;God, it&#39;s so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you&#39;re seeing &#34;
 &#39;so far?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn&#39;t gonna smell like a garden, &#34;
 &#34;Butters. But I think it&#39;s coming together real nice.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes, well, I&#39;ve done my job, haven&#39;t I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la &#34;
 &#39;taco la trabajar!&#39;,
 &#34;Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I&#39;m sure your parents will be plenty &#34;
 &#39;pissed off.&#39;,
 &#34;Ooo, ah, that&#39;s a different company.  Oh! Someone&#39;s here! We&#39;d better run &#34;
 &#39;out the back! Pepite! Carlos! \xad¡Vamonos!&#39;,
 &#39;Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, &#39;
 &#39;maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think &#39;
 &#34;about who I&#39;m going to become.&#34;,
 &#39;Who the hell are you?&#39;,
 &#34; Oh wow, really? That&#39;s so awesome! Now I&#39;ll really work to be successful!&#34;,
 &#34;Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I&#39;m not that stupid! Just for that, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I waunt, and doin&#39; drugs when I &#34;
 &#34;waunt!  Whatevuh! I&#39;ll do what I waunt!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re done?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, so how&#39;s it look?&#34;,
 &#34;But I&#39;ll still be getting presents this year, right?&#34;,

 &#34;Three?? You didn&#39;t deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this &#34;
 &#39;one? &#39;,
 &#39;It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.&#39;,
 &#39; God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!&#39;,
 &#34;Haven&#39;t you seen the Haibo doll? It&#39;s like a pet, a robot pet. You have to &#34;
 &#34;feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it&#39;s the coolest thing ever! Santa &#34;
 &#39;has to bring me one!&#39;,
 &#39; Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!&#39;,
 &#34;Well there&#39;s still time before Christmas! Can&#39;t I still make up for it?&#34;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#39; Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just letting you know how special you are to me.&#34;,
 &#34;You guys, that&#39;s it!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less &#34;
 &#39;fortunate! Follow me!  You guys, come on! Right now! &#39;,
 &#34; ...and here&#39;s some old toys that I don&#39;t need anymore.  And here! Here&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this&#39;ll the &#34;
 &#39;happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights &#39;
 &#34;down from the door. We&#39;ll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.&#34;,
 &#34;They don&#39;t have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas &#39;
 &#39;to you!&#39;,
 &#39;The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.&#39;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#39;Wow!&#39;,
 &#39; Get the rest of the stuff you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!&#39;,
 &#39;Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and &#39;
 &#39;sing!&#39;,
 &#39;Wow, is that where Santa lives?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, that&#39;s so lame of them. &#34;,
 &#34; Well Santa, it&#39;s just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who &#34;
 &#39;are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it &#39;
 &#34;wouldn&#39;t hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s what I thought.&#34;,
 &#39;Hooray!&#39;,
 &#34;No! Santa Claus can&#39;t be dead. He... He can&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#39;Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!&#39;,
 &#34; Now I&#39;m never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not stupid! It&#39;s a toy that you can starve! If you don&#39;t feed it, it &#34;
 &#34;dies. It&#39;s sooo cool.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, Christ.&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, gang, it&#39;s up to us to save Christmas!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-&#39;,
 &#34;Wow, look, you guys! We&#39;re riding in Santa&#39;s sleigh!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m riding in Santa&#39;s sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With &#34;
 &#39;candy-cane wishes and smiles-&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;,
 &#34; Hey, it isn&#39;t my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!&#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with &#34;
 &#39;candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus!&#39;,
 &#39;This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor &#39;
 &#39;unfortunate people.&#39;,
 &#39;This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;Look at me, I&#39;m riding high in Santa&#39;s sleigh. It&#39;s Christmas special time &#34;
 &#39;for me-&#39;,
 &#34;Eh, it&#39;s not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand &#34;
 &#39;what Christmas means.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, God-damnit!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it&#39;s worthless and gay! &#34;
 &#34;God-damnit I&#39;ll never try to be nice again! &#34;,
 &#39; Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?&#39;,
 &#39; Bush is a Naizi&#39;,
 &#39;...Eh the... Founding who? &#39;,
 &#34; Ugh. UGHuh.  I can&#39;t do it! This is waaay too much material for a &#34;
 &#39;nine-year-old! &#39;,
 &#39;But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.&#39;,
 &#39;Maaaa. M-maaaa.&#39;,
 &#39;Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I &#39;
 &#39;wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? &#39;
 &#39;In those days?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m trying to have a flashback.&#34;,
 &#39;You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like &#39;
 &#39;first-hand!&#39;,
 &#34;Nonono. I&#39;ve seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. &#34;
 &#39;How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would &#39;
 &#39;have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh &#39;
 &#34;waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don&#39;t even care about &#34;
 &#34;1776. It was so long ago, that I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with me.  &#34;
 &#39;With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.&#39;,
 &#39; Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m about to find out all about what happened back in &#34;
 &#39;1776. &#39;,
 &#39;All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through &#39;
 &#34;this doorway. I&#39;ll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And &#34;
 &#39;then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!&#39;,
 &#39;Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. &#39;
 &#39;Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please?  Oh Gee. I wonder what it &#39;
 &#39;used to be like in the year 1776. &#39;,
 &#39;Benjamin Franklin?&#39;,
 &#39; Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!&#39;,
 &#34;Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you&#39;re just in time.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!&#39;,
 &#39;I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. &#39;
 &#39;When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining &#39;
 &#39;our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!&#39;,
 &#39;Or a really sweet one. &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, here it goes! &#39;,
 &#39;Ohhh awesome!!! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?&#39;,
 &#39;Oho yes! I did it I did it!&#39;,
 &#39;Oho kick fucking ass, dude! &#39;,
 &#34;No, I&#39;m not from here at all. I&#39;m having a flashback.&#34;,
 &#34;Well you know, it&#39;s a...  H-ho, awesome!  Look at me, I&#39;m back in time, in &#34;
 &#39;1776. With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of &#39;
 &#34;bricks. What a special magic time, and it&#39;s all alive for me I&#39;m so glad &#34;
 &#34;Stan and Kyle aren&#39;t here. I hate those guys, seriously. Seriuosly hate &#34;
 &#39;those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Super neato! &#39;,
 &#39;But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, okay.I guess I understand.  I don&#39;t wanna wait for our life to be &#34;
 &#34;over...  I don&#39;t wanna wait for our life to be over...&#34;,
 &#39;And I am the official messenger boy, I am.&#39;,
 &#39; Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a bitch, ain&#39;t it?&#34;,
 &#39;Wow.&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa, how very very relevant.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, it&#39;s Benjamin Franklin. It&#39;s Benjamin Franklin. It&#39;s Benjamin Franklin.&#34;,
 &#39;Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to &#39;
 &#39;my time. To my time, to, to my time.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow!&#39;,
 &#39; Everyone, stop! Please! &#39;,
 &#34;If you all don&#39;t mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the &#34;
 &#39;founding fathers would say.&#39;,
 &#34;I learned somethin&#39; today. This country was founded by some of the smartest &#34;
 &#39;thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truely &#39;
 &#34;great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn&#39;t want &#34;
 &#39;to.  You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they &#39;
 &#34;make the country look like it&#39;s made of sane, caring individuals. And you &#34;
 &#39;people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole &#39;
 &#34;country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we&#39;d get taken &#34;
 &#34;down in a second. That&#39;s why the founding fathers decided we should have &#34;
 &#39;both. It\&#39;s called &#34;having your cake and eating it too.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, &#39;
 &#39;as long as we agree that America kicks ass.&#39;,
 &#34;We didn&#39;t go to your comedy show.&#34;,
 &#39;Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.&#39;,
 &#34; Hey, wait a minute!  You guys can&#39;t just start a club and tell me I can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;be in it!&#39;,
 &#39;Can too!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh God-damnit!!&#39;,
 &#34;But they say I can&#39;t be in their club!!&#34;,
 &#39; Put more clay on the balls.&#39;,
 &#39; What a crime. &#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t do that!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re an art teacher!&#34;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do &#34;
 &#39;something drastic.&#39;,
 &#39;Like find out where Mrs. Dreible lives, and go over there, and... TP her &#39;
 &#39;house.&#39;,
 &#39;Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.&#39;,
 &#34; What&#39;s the matter, Kyle? You chicken?  Ugh! &#34;,
 &#39; Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!&#39;,
 &#39;Should be fine.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. &#39;,
 &#39;Yep. All set.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, we&#39;re just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.&#34;,
 &#34;Heh yeah, that that&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#39;No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the right address-wait! Look there!  There&#39;s Mrs. Dreible! This is the &#34;
 &#39;place. &#39;,
 &#39;So?&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, you&#39;re bein&#39; an asshole! Now let&#39;s do this thing and get out of &#34;
 &#34;m&#39;yeah.  Here&#39;s what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! &#34;,
 &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go! &#34;,
 &#39;Aw man, that was sooo awesome! &#39;,
 &#39;Who cares??&#39;,
 &#34;Me??  There&#39;s toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah? Well, Ol&#39; Mrs. Dreible probably had it comin&#39; to her.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I understand the people who did it weren&#39;t caughts, so-o... Looks like &#34;
 &#39;nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. &#39;,
 &#39; Damn!&#39;,
 &#39;Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to &#39;
 &#34;our story, we&#39;ll be fine.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, &#39;
 &#39;at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast &#39;
 &#39;Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her &#39;
 &#34;autograph, but she didn&#39;t have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but &#34;
 &#39;on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all &#39;
 &#39;personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in &#39;
 &#39;Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home &#39;
 &#39;and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally &#39;
 &#39;got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary &#39;
 &#39;Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, it&#39;s very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the &#34;
 &#39;way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all &#39;
 &#39;personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in &#39;
 &#39;Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home &#39;
 &#39;and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally &#39;
 &#39;got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary &#39;
 &#39;Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, for Christ&#39;s sake!&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  &#34;And so I said, &#39;
 &#39;\&#39;That\&#39;s a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.\&#39;&#34; Oh, hello, Mr. &#39;
 &#39;Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?&#39;,
 &#39;Touché, Mr. Mackey, touché.&#39;,
 &#39;They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the &#39;
 &#39;other three for a better deal.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill &#39;
 &#39;you!&#39;,
 &#39; Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?&#39;,
 &#39;No need. I have one for you right here. &#39;,
 &#39;Is there anything else I can get for you?&#39;,
 &#39;You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39;Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the &#39;
 &#39;counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, you know. He&#39;s losing it. He&#39;s gonna crack.&#34;,
 &#34;Kyle can&#39;t take the heat; he&#39;s gonna sing like a canary. Then we&#39;re all &#34;
 &#39;gonna take the fall for what we did.&#39;,
 &#39; Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who &#39;
 &#39;the weakest link is!&#39;,
 &#39;We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Why not?&#39;,
 &#34;He almost spilled the beans in the counselor&#39;s office! He can&#39;t even keep &#34;
 &#34;the story straight! I&#39;m telling you guys, he&#39;s weak. He&#39;s weak, and he&#39;ll be &#34;
 &#39;the end of all of us. &#39;,
 &#34;I just wanted to see how you&#39;re doing, Kyle. Why don&#39;t we go out for a &#34;
 &#39;little boat ride?&#39;,
 &#39;I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.&#39;,
 &#34;Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;go.  So how are things, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;And you feel like you have to confess.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s gonna take a while. &#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet &#34;
 &#39;unconsciousness. &#39;,
 &#34;Won&#39;t be long, Kyle. &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.&#34;,
 &#39;They did?&#39;,
 &#39;But can I still kill Kyyyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, can we see them-him-her?&#39;,
 &#39;What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present &#39;
 &#39;all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!&#39;,
 &#39; Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?&#39;,
 &#39;You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? &#39;
 &#39;Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?&#39;,
 &#39;What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.&#39;,
 &#34;Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don&#39;t seem to understand. We&#39;re we&#39;re not gonna get &#34;
 &#39;punished for this. Ever.&#39;,
 &#39;So... so then, how can you feel bad?&#39;,
 &#34;...But he&#39;s not gonna get in trouble.&#34;,
 &#34;What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There&#39;s nothing to feel bad about! We&#39;re, we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;off scot-free!&#39;,
 &#39; For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might &#39;
 &#39;get in trouble later?&#39;,
 &#34;Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin&#39; weirdos, man!&#34;,
 &#39;Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s over this way! Come on!&#34;,
 &#39;So how are things, guys?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let that happen.&#34;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t I? &#34;,
 &#39; Hi guys.&#39;,
 &#34;I told them everything, you guys. It&#39;s over.&#34;,
 &#39;My consciences just caught up with me.&#39;,
 &#39;I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get &#39;
 &#39;caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.&#39;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.&#34;,
 &#39;Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-&#39;,
 &#39;Hm.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead!  Ow!&#39;,
 &#39; Uuugh.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a &#39;
 &#39;sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door &#39;

 &#39;hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big &#39;
 &#39;heads and big black eyes…&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,

 &#34;Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you&#39;re just tryin&#39; to scare me.&#34;,

 &#39; Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless &#39;

 &#39;Nope! It has to be Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34; Come, Kyle. Do hurry.  Go ahead, it won&#39;t bite. &#34;,
 &#34; I couldn&#39;t resist. I&#39;m sorry. &#34;,
 &#39; Okay. Okay okay. &#39;,

 &#39;Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, all right, I&#39;m sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;No, go ahead. I&#39;m dry.&#34;,
 &#34;But it was one of the best times I&#39;ve ever had.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay.  Ohhh! God-damnit! &#39;,
 &#34;This is so awesome. I don&#39;t think I made it out of that proctologist&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.&#39;,
 &#34;Ugh. I don&#39;t wanna play anymore, you guys.&#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s that guy you want! He&#39;s trying to reverse your polarities!&#34;,
 &#39;What are you doing, man?! &#39;,
 &#34;When do we get to eat. I&#39;m hungry.&#34;,
 &#34;Ah. Uh! I&#39;m trapped inside Helen Hunt&#39;s ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!&#34;,
 &#39; ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.&#39;,
 &#39;This is like my fifth time. &#39;,

 &#34;Yeah! We&#39;d never do that on Earth! &#34;,
 &#39; Tell us about it!&#39;,
 &#39;No.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s even World War Three to look forward to.&#34;,
 &#39; Uuugh.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.&#34;,
 &#39;What is it, Chef?&#39;,
 &#39; Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in &#39;
 &#34;America. But you don&#39;t have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss &#34;
 &#39;Jennifer Lopez.&#39;,
 &#39; Miss Lopez, come on out here. &#39;,

 &#34;I don&#39;t care, &#39;cause I&#39;m the one that&#39;s gonna get in trouble if you don&#39;t-! &#34;
 &#39;Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!&#39;,

 &#39;Aww crap.&#39;,
 &#39;OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!&#39;,
 &#39;I told you this would happen. &#39;,
 &#34;Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we&#39;re staying away from Ben Affleck.&#34;,
 &#39;EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! &#39;,
 &#39;Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!&#39;,
 &#39;You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!&#39;,

 &#34;S&#39;aright.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, balls!&#39;,
 &#39; Guys, I need to talk to you.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I &#34;
 &#34;just can&#39;t go on living with Ms. Lopez.&#34;,
 &#39;Stop doing what?&#39;,
 &#34;Please, you guys. It&#39;s like, I can&#39;t even have a moment to myself anymore. &#34;
 &#39;See? &#39;,
 &#34;Look! I&#39;m just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. &#34;
 &#39;Lopez.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.&#39;,
 &#39;Quiet, Ms. Lopez.&#39;,
 &#39;Guys... Uh... Uh... &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don&#39;t care what you guys believe. But &#34;
 &#34;with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn&#39;t it possible, just &#34;
 &#34;possible, that something I don&#39;t understand happened here?&#34;,
 &#39; Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!&#39;,
 &#34;Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We&#39;re wondering if you have any &#34;
 &#39;crimes to be solved, for a dollar.&#39;,
 &#39;Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?&#39;,
 &#39;My God...&#39;,
 &#39;What have you got, Marsh?&#39;,
 &#34; Jesus, we&#39;re too late.&#34;,
 &#39;Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  &#34;Why won\&#39;t she let me eat that pie? &#39;
 &#39;Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!&#34; His only solution &#39;
 &#39;became obvious: Kill her!&#39;,
 &#39;Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. &#39;,
 &#39;The torso he would dump into the lake. &#39;,
 &#34;And then, finally, he&#39;d be able to eat that pie.&#34;,
 &#39;Looks like the game is over, old man! &#39;,
 &#39;Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington&#39;,
 &#39; Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and &#39;
 &#34;coffee! We&#39;re not paying you to sit on your ass!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll find your doll.&#34;,
 &#39;No sign of forced entry.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re going to need semen samples from everything in this room. &#34;,
 &#34;Hey, this is our case! You can&#39;t come in and take over!&#34;,
 &#39;Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.&#39;,
 &#39;Right. I think I know exactly where to start.&#39;,
 &#34; Where were you this morning at nine o&#39;clock, Butters?!&#34;,
 &#34;Your story is full of holes and I&#39;m gonna beat your ass if you don&#39;t start &#34;
 &#34;tellin&#39; the truth! &#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re going down, Butters! You hear me?!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re worth a two-dollar criminal and you&#39;re lying!&#34;,
 &#34;Fine! Then you won&#39;t mind giving us a semen sample. &#34;,
 &#39;You just make the semen come out of your body and fill it in this cup!&#39;,
 &#39;Stop playing games!&#39;,
 &#34;That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;know how you make seme come out of your body.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. I was hoping you guys did.&#34;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don&#39;t know how to make semen come out?!&#34;,
 &#39;Follow me to the bathroom. &#39;,
 &#39;Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your weiner until white stuff &#39;
 &#39;comes out, and then put it in this cup.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, retard. Semen comes from your weiner. Now do it!  Well Butters?!&#39;,
 &#39;Well pull harder!&#39;,
 &#34;Try doin&#39; it faster&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!&#39;,
 &#34;The you&#39;d better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!&#34;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go! &#34;,
 &#39; Kyle! &#39;,
 &#34; I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson&#39;s doll, you stupid Jew!&#34;,
 &#34;Well if they&#39;re not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. &#34;
 &#34;Let&#39;s go tell on them. &#34;,
 &#39;Why not?&#39;,
 &#34;Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain&#39;t got!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah! This was our hot lead!&#39;,
 &#34;Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There&#39;s a little doll in &#34;
 &#39;there about to have her head twisted off!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, that does it! Cover me! I&#39;m going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!&#34;,
 &#39;We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.&#39;,
 &#39;Kewl!&#39;,
 &#39;Uh bonus?&#39;,
 &#39;Me neither.&#39;,
 &#34; Hey! Broflovski&#39;s a good cop!&#34;,
 &#39;Awwwwrrr-auugh. &#39;,
 &#39;We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.&#39;,
 &#34; Will you get off my back?! It&#39;s hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now &#34;
 &#34;I gotta come home to your nagging?!  Look look, I&#39;m I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just &#34;
 &#34;this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I&#39;m tired, alright? I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m tired.&#34;,
 &#39; Okay. &#39;,
 &#39; Butters?&#39;,
 &#39;Are you still trying to give a semen sample?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, keep tryin&#39;, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39; A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?&#39;,
 &#39;Un oh...&#39;,
 &#39;Bang bang bang... &#39;,
 &#39; Kenny, it doesn\&#39;t go &#34;Pakew! Pakew!&#34;, it goes &#34;BANG BANG BANG!!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39; Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That &#39;
 &#39;will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.&#39;,
 &#39;You did?&#39;,
 &#39;Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?&#39;,
 &#39;Man, Indians have it good, huh?&#39;,
 &#34; All right, let&#39;s go! &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!&#34;,
 &#34;Well, you shouldn&#39;t be such a dick, dude. &#34;,
 &#34;Because they&#39;re rich, greedy-ass Indians!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#34; Wait a minute! I&#39;ve got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! &#34;
 &#39;And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, &#39;
 &#34;let&#39;s go!  No? We can&#39;t give Kyle AIDS?&#34;,
 &#34;Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin&#39; a little better now.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick &#39;em in the nuts!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re all a bunch of God-damned pussies! &#34;,
 &#39;What? Tell us?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!&#39;,
 &#39; What a dork!&#39;,
 &#39;Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. &#39;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;gonna be all over us.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, please Craig, we&#39;re ten times gayer than you!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! We&#39;re all just super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!&#34;,
 &#39;GOD I HATE CRAIG!!  That son of a... djah!! &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re straight like a freedway!&#34;,
 &#39;You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!&#39;,
 &#34;...So? I&#39;m half bisexual!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.&#34;,
 &#34;Have you guys seen this? It&#39;s a conditioner that you can leave in, and it &#34;
 &#39;detoxifies the scalp.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. It&#39;s a charcoal-based thing that-&#34;,
 &#39;Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the &#39;
 &#34;kids in school are talking, okay? And they&#39;re spreading rumors that we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;We have no choice, you guys. We&#39;re just gonna have to kill Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, you know, you&#39;re right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang &#34;
 &#39;around us anymore.&#39;,
 &#39;You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us &#39;
 &#34;anymore. I think he&#39;s right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;be easy.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not our friend. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, and let&#39;s see Craig outgay us now.&#34;,
 &#34; That&#39;s right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a &#34;
 &#39;metrosexual pride parade.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, don&#39;t be such a fag, dude! &#34;,
 &#39;God damnit! &#39;,
 &#39; Heheheheheh heheheheheh.&#39;,
 &#34; Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that&#39;s it. Inspiration, you guys. Don&#39;t you &#34;
 &#39;see?&#39;,
 &#34; Think about it! It&#39;s the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we &#34;
 &#39;just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christiand will buy &#39;
 &#39;our crap!&#39;,
 &#39; It worked for Creed!&#39;,
 &#34; You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It&#39;s genious!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band &#39;
 &#39;that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! &#39;,
 &#39;Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a &#39;
 &#39;platinum album! Hurry, Butters! &#39;,
 &#39;No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass &#39;
 &#39;guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! &#39;,
 &#34; Your family&#39;s black, Token! There&#39;s bound to be a bass guitar in your &#34;
 &#39;basement somewhere! &#39;,
 &#39;Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. &#39;,
 &#39;I told you, Token.&#39;,
 &#39;Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, &#39;
 &#39;financially-windfalling experiences of our young lives.&#39;,
 &#39;We are going to start... a Christian rock band.&#39;,
 &#34;Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you&#39;ll regret it the rest of your &#34;
 &#39;life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty &#39;
 &#39;million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve &#39;
 &#39;dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- &#39;,
 &#39;Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make &#39;
 &#39;Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? &#39;
 &#39;All we have to do is cross out words like &#34;baby&#34; and &#34;Darling&#34; and replace &#39;
 &#39;them with  Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very &#39;
 &#39;nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.&#39;,
 &#34; Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You&#39;re black. You can &#34;
 &#39;play bass.&#39;,
 &#39;Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! &#39;,
 &#34;All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.  I need you in my life, Jesus. I can&#39;t live &#34;
 &#39;without you, Jesus And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.&#39;,
 &#39;Almost there, you guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a &#39;
 &#39;hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m going to kill you one day, Token.&#34;,
 &#39;Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I &#39;
 &#39;have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. &#39;,
 &#34;No no no! Haven&#39;t you guys ever seen an album cover? You&#39;re supposed to be &#34;
 &#34;standing in random places, looking away like you don&#39;t care! &#34;,
 &#34;No! Butters, you can&#39;t look happy on the album cover! That&#39;s not cool!&#34;,
 &#39;Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!&#39;,
 &#34;So it looks like you&#39;re too cool to care that you&#39;re on an album cover, you &#34;
 &#34;black asshole! Now just hold it!  Our first album cover.  Don&#39;t ever leave &#34;
 &#34;me, Jesus. I couldn&#39;t stand to see you go. My heart would simply snap, my &#34;
 &#34;Lord, if you walked on out that door. I promise I&#39;ll be good to you, and &#34;
 &#34;keep you warm at night. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don&#39;t we just... shut off &#34;
 &#39;the lights.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh hey guys. How&#39;s it going?&#34;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, &#34;
 &#39;the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that &#34;
 &#39;ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The &#34;
 &#39;single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a &#39;
 &#34;walkng, praying wallet full of cash. And I&#39;ll be there selling my album.&#34;,
 &#39;I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Tata! &#39;,
 &#34;Yes, it&#39;s really the best Christian album that&#39;s evern been produced, &#34;
 &#39;actually..&#39;,
 &#34; I think that&#39;s what the whole world needs, praise Christ.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.&#39;,
 &#34; Damnit! If we&#39;re gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on &#34;
 &#39;that stage! &#39;,
 &#39;Who are you?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, you guys are real hard core.&#39;,
 &#39;Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.&#39;,
 &#34; Let&#39;s just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in &#34;
 &#39;Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... &#39;,
 &#34;You know, Jesus? I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;why I wrote this song. I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me  I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby! You died for my sins, &#39;
 &#34;and you know that I would die for you, right? What&#39;s the matter, baby? You &#34;
 &#39;tremble at Jesus, baby! Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without &#39;
 &#34;you, there&#39;s a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh! I wanna believe. It&#39;s all &#34;
 &#34;right, &#39;cause I get lonely in the night and it&#39;s up to you to Save me! &#34;
 &#39;Jee...sus...bay-by!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, we sure do.&#39;,
 &#34; Well what are you saying? That, that you don&#39;t really love Christ??&#34;,
 &#34;Well what&#39;s the difference?! You love Christ, you&#39;re in love with Christ, I &#34;
 &#39;mean, uh, what the heck is this??&#39;,
 &#39;I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the &#39;
 &#34;money! If I&#39;m lying may the Lord strike me down right now.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn&#39;t born again yesterday. I wanna get &#34;
 &#39;down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all &#39;
 &#39;over my face!&#39;,
 &#34;The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer&#39;s body, all muscled up and toned! The Body &#34;
 &#34;of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own! You&#39;re one time, &#34;
 &#39;two times, three times my Savior... Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t help but think that he looks kinda hot...&#34;,
 &#39;Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin &#39;
 &#39;shortly.&#39;,
 &#39;Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re Faith Plus One, Token, there&#39;ll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, &#34;
 &#34;black asshole.  There&#39;s hors d&#39;oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, &#34;

 &#39;out platinum albums!&#39;,
 &#39;OH, FUCK JESUS!! &#39;,
 &#34; Who fuckin&#39; cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I&#39;ll say it again! &#34;
 &#39;Fuck Jesus! &#39;,
 &#39;Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;markets. Mostly&#39;,
 &#39; With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for &#39;
 &#39;the goal and paases the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to &#39;
 &#39;the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once &#39;
 &#39;and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.&#34;,
 &#34;Looks like Stan&#39;s dad&#39;s been hittin&#39; the bottle again.&#34;,
 &#39; Calm down! We cannot understand you!&#39;,
 &#39;Old people!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh God, they&#39;re coming! &#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re not gonna stop until we&#39;re all dead!&#34;,
 &#34;Ooooh, isn&#39;t this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that &#34;
 &#39;old people are confined to their homes where they belong?&#39;,
 &#34;My God, he&#39;s right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even &#34;
 &#34;though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don&#39;t know if I ever &#34;
 &#39;told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I believe that&#39;s us... thank God. &#34;,
 &#39;More old people!&#39;,
 &#39;Old people gone mad!&#39;,
 &#39;So our only solution is to cut off their life force.&#39;,
 &#39;No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won&#39;t know what to &#34;
 &#39;do.&#39;,
 &#39;Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat &#39;
 &#39;Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.&#39;,
 &#34;I think I have a plan, though we&#39;ll have to do it tonight.  We&#39;ll start by &#34;
 &#39;sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and &#39;
 &#39;Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan &#39;
 &#34;and I sneak into the Mayor&#39;s office  and steal some of the explosives the &#34;
 &#34;old people have stashed. Nine o&#39;clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen &#34;
 &#34;Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle&#39;s chest. We say &#34;
 &#39;our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them we send him inside. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, right, or we could always do that.&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe he caught a disease and died. That&#39;d be so awesome.&#34;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s joking? &#34;,
 &#39;You have AIDS?&#39;,
 &#39; Wow! Casa Bonita?!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, haven&#39;t you ever been there?! It&#39;s a big Mexican restaurant where they &#34;
 &#34;have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart&#39;s Cave and  all kinds of stuff!&#34;,
 &#39;This Saturday! Awesone!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive &#39;
 &#39;atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!&#39;,
 &#39;You... your Mom said you could take three friends.&#39;,
 &#39;Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides &#39;
 &#39;Stan and Kenny?&#39;,
 &#34;Butters?! You&#39;re gonna take THAT butthole?! Why?!&#34;,
 &#39;I have never been a dick to you.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, except maybe for that one time.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, you don&#39;t understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the &#34;
 &#34;whole world. I&#39;ll just, I&#39;ll just die if you don&#39;t take me! Please! &#34;,
 &#34; Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don&#39;t wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;d much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom &#34;
 &#34;for a day!  Kiss my ball, asshole!!  Dude, I totally didn&#39;t mean that, Kyle. &#34;
 &#34;Ah I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I&#39;m sorry we had that fight just &#34;
 &#39;now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I &#39;
 &#34;think it was good and we we&#39;ve moved past it.&#34;,
 &#39; Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die! &#39;,
 &#39;Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black &#39;
 &#34;Bart&#39;s Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! &#34;,
 &#39; No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get &#39;
 &#34;invited to go! I&#39;m just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!&#34;,
 &#39; Hi Kyle. &#39;,
 &#34;What isn&#39;t it?&#34;,
 &#34;...I don&#39;t understand the difference.&#34;,
 &#39;Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with &#39;
 &#39;people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how &#34;do&#34; you act nice to &#39;
 &#39;people?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?&#39;,
 &#39;Like what?&#39;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;,
 &#34;Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don&#39;t you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  &#34;
 &#39;Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.&#34;,
 &#39;Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Well what?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.&#34;,
 &#34;So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of &#39;
 &#34;crap, but we&#39;ve also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone &#34;
 &#34;doesn&#39;t make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you &#34;
 &#39;know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.&#39;,
 &#34;I know, Kyle. I&#39;ll see ya later. &#34;,
 &#34;I care, sure, but I hope it doesn&#39;t mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;hang out anymore.&#39;,
 &#39;Good.&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!&#39;,
 &#39; Butters, can you keep a secret?&#39;,
 &#34;For the past five days I&#39;ve been looking out into space for a school &#34;
 &#39;project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something &#39;
 &#39;terrible.&#39;,
 &#39;A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.&#39;,
 &#34;Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I&#39;m wrong, but, I just want &#34;
 &#39;you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?&#39;,
 &#39;Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God! Does it look like it&#39;s getting closer? &#34;,
 &#34;Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it&#39;s on a collision course &#34;
 &#39;for Earth.&#39;,
 &#34;I, I don&#39;t know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base &#34;
 &#39;9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.&#39;,
 &#39;According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than &#39;
 &#39;four hours.&#39;,
 &#39;No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to &#39;
 &#34;live! We just... We&#39;ve gotta find a bomb shelter!&#34;,
 &#34;Stan&#39;s Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his back yard! Come on, &#34;
 &#39;Butters! Hurry! &#39;,
 &#34;Here we go! The bomb shelter&#39;s down here! &#34;,
 &#39; All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last &#39;
 &#39;us for weeks.&#39;,
 &#34;No! Butters! I can&#39;t let you risk it. I&#39;ll go up and get the others.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not sure of anythng anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what &#34;
 &#34;happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don&#39;t make it back &#34;
 &#39;in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word &#39;
 &#39;from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. &#39;,
 &#39; Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.&#39;,
 &#39;Hope you have a good one. See you later. &#39;,
 &#39;Yes?&#39;,
 &#34; Butters didn&#39;t show? I I can&#39;t believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the &#34;
 &#39;right time and everything?&#39;,
 &#39;Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I &#39;
 &#39;guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.&#39;,
 &#39; Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let&#39;s get going, shall we?&#34;,
 &#34; Ee-yeah yeah. I think you&#39;re right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters &#34;
 &#39;would want us to go. You know Butters...&#39;,
 &#34;Next Saturday?? I&#39;ll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... &#34;
 &#39;depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a &#39;
 &#39;whole week?!&#39;,
 &#39; Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!&#39;,
 &#39; The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no &#39;
 &#39;time... no time...&#39;,
 &#39;There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each &#39;
 &#39;other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated &#39;
 &#39;instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... &#39;
 &#39;radiation. &#39;,
 &#34;No Butters!! If you come up, you&#39;ll get infected too! You best wait for the &#34;
 &#39;radiatino level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. &#39;
 &#39;Ugh...&#39;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t come down there, or else, we&#39;ll contaminate you, Butters. No... we &#34;
 &#39;just have to survive the best we can. &#39;,
 &#34;Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I&#39;ve got to go. &#34;
 &#39;Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  &#39;
 &#39;G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.&#39;,
 &#34; Heh you&#39;re not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to &#34;
 &#39;Casa Bonita. &#39;,
 &#39;What what what?&#39;,
 &#39;UUuuugh!! &#39;,
 &#34; Oh God! They&#39;re coming! They&#39;re coming! We&#39;be gotta get out of here! &#34;
 &#34;They&#39;re coming this way!&#34;,
 &#34;The cannibals! Don&#39;t you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. &#34;
 &#39;Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who &#39;
 &#39;survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re coming this way! I can hear them coming. They&#39;ll find you down here &#34;
 &#34;for sure. And when they do, they&#39;ll eat you alive.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic &#34;
 &#39;radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you &#39;
 &#39;protected from the toxins.&#39;,
 &#34;Believe me, Butters, you don&#39;t wanna see what&#39;s up there. Now come on. I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#34;guide you to a safer location.  There you go. Two more steps and you&#39;re at &#34;
 &#39;the top.  Good.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. There&#39;s nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out &#34;
 &#39;buildings, and what used to be our town.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. &#39;,
 &#34;Right now we&#39;re walking by what used to be people&#39;s houses, now just &#34;
 &#39;smoldering burnt piles of rubble.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth &#34;
 &#39;over two miles in diameter.&#39;,
 &#39;Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We &#39;
 &#39;might be safe here.  Oh my God!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! &#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He&#39;s humanity&#39;s last &#34;
 &#39;hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!&#39;,
 &#34; Aw man, he&#39;s eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones &#34;
 &#39;crack? &#39;,
 &#34;Wait! Look here! There&#39;s a dead body with an axe in the back. I&#39;ll pull out &#34;
 &#34;the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal&#39;s head. Hunh!  Die! &#34;,
 &#34; The cannibal! The cannibal&#39;s dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means &#34;
 &#39;soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.&#39;,
 &#39;We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t get to you!&#34;,
 &#34;Look! There&#39;s an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I&#39;ll break off the &#34;
 &#39;handle so nobody can get to you!&#39;,
 &#39;Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! &#39;
 &#34;Must... fight... it... Don&#39;t open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter &#34;
 &#34;what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here&#39;s some water and food from &#34;
 &#39;the shelter.&#39;,
 &#39;I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! &#39;,
 &#34;Hah!  It&#39;s Wednesday! It&#39;s Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa &#34;
 &#34;Bonita.  I&#39;m gonna go through Black Bart&#39;s Cave first. No! I&#39;m gonna watch &#34;
 &#34;the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it&#39;s my birthday, they&#39;ll let &#34;
 &#39;me cliff-dive in the pool!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re on our way to Casa Bonita! We&#39;re gonna be there very soon. You&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there&#39;s this one part where you can &#34;
 &#39;dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.&#39;,
 &#39; &#34;Pretty cool.&#34; So, um, should we go to Black Bart\&#39;s Cave first or watch &#39;
 &#34;the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart&#39;s Cave right away &#34;
 &#34;&#39;cause, we&#39;re gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we&#39;ll watch &#34;
 &#39;the cliff divers before the puppet show.&#39;,
 &#34;What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we&#39;ll do &#34;
 &#39;whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Happy Birthday to you. Happy- &#39;,

 &#39;But... Casa Bonita.&#39;,

 &#39;Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!&#39;,
 &#39;Go kick his ass, Stan.&#39;,
 &#34;Will he bleed? That&#39;s all we care about.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I&#39;ve got five bucks on the other kid. &#34;
 &#39;Who wants in?&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re just standing there, talking. &#34;,
 &#39;You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?&#39;,
 &#34; Aww, you guys. I think Stan&#39;s in love.&#34;,
 &#34;Ohhh, here&#39;s Stan&#39;s little girlfriend now.&#34;,
 &#34; Awww, look at them. Aren&#39;t they so cute together?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God...&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, that&#39;s cool. We&#39;re gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us &#34;
 &#39;have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. &#39;,
 &#39;Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. &#39;,
 &#39; Oh no! You guys broke up?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.&#39;,
 &#39;Damn, that kid is cool, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going to kill myself &#34;,
 &#34;You guys, Kenny&#39;s eating his own hands. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. &#39;,
 &#39; Nothing.&#39;,
 &#34;Nothin&#39; Na- Due-nothing. &#34;,
 &#39;Gross dude! &#39;,
 &#34;No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don&#39;t have any cigarettes.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re sorry.&#34;,
 &#39;Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, huh?  Ih, it&#39;s like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- &#34;
 &#39;No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!&#39;,
 &#34;Why? It&#39;s perfect. If everyone&#39;s blaming the tobacco companies, then &#34;
 &#34;nobody&#39;s blaming us.&#34;,
 &#34;Dumbass, you don&#39;t wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?&#34;,
 &#39;Got it! &#39;,
 &#34; Isn&#39;t he awesome, you guys?&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He&#39;s my idol. &#34;,
 &#34;Handle it? For two billion dollars I&#39;d handle my grandpa&#39;s balls, sir.&#34;,
 &#34; Which means, if it weren&#39;t for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;be here today.&#39;,
 &#34;Wow. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit &#34;
 &#39;of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God, that is what I&#39;ve always said.  I love this guy!&#34;,
 &#34;God, he&#39;s just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold &#34;
 &#39;drink, perhaps?&#39;,
 &#39;So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, &#39;
 &#39;huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!&#39;,
 &#34; Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That&#39;s your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me &#34;
 &#34;think you don&#39;t care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;either. Ooops. didn&#39;t work, did it, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;Sure you don&#39;t, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you&#39;re gonna say &#34;
 &#39;next. You\&#39;re gonna say, &#34;How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?&#34; &#39;
 &#34;And then I&#39;m supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by &#34;
 &#34;yourself and do the commercial. That&#39;s Serbian Jew double bluff and it &#34;
 &#34;ain&#39;t  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the &#34;
 &#39;commecial, gentlemen. The game... is on. &#39;,
 &#34;Sorry Kyle, but I&#39;m afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the &#34;
 &#39;comemrcial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew &#39;
 &#34;double bluff, didn&#39;t you?! Well let&#39;s see you try to open this door now.  &#34;
 &#39;Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- &#39;,
 &#34; Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.Wait, this isn&#39;t my house.&#34;,
 &#34;Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let&#39;s see you try to get through the door &#34;
 &#39;now! Haa haa hahahahaha!&#39;,
 &#39; Heh, ho-okay. &#39;,
 &#34;Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there&#39;s no proof that &#34;
 &#34;second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there&#39;s no proof that &#34;
 &#34;second-hand smoke kills. I&#39;ve just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. &#34;
 &#34;I guess... I&#39;m the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand &#34;
 &#34;smoke doesn&#39;t kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this &#34;
 &#34;commercial, I&#39;ll be... dead.  Dead??&#34;,
 &#39;Uh what... what does that mean, &#34;I\&#39;ll be dead&#34;? Hey, uh what, what was that &#39;
 &#39;&#34;dead&#34; part?&#39;,
 &#34;Uh, nnno, thanks. I&#39;m not hungry.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not eating the cupcake.&#34;,
 &#39; Jesus Christ! HAAAA!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re going to kill me! &#34;,
 &#39;The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke &#39;
 &#34;and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They&#39;ll stop at &#34;
 &#39;nothing!!&#39;,
 &#39; You guys have to help me!&#39;,
 &#34; Please, you guys, I don&#39;t know what to do!&#34;,
 &#39;If I go, you guys go!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, maybe that&#39;s it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! &#34;,
 &#34;Well that&#39;s fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was &#34;

 &#34;Okay, um, we&#39;re gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  &#34;

 &#34;Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;definitely asking for that for Christmas.&#39;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t go to Canada, dumbass! It&#39;s Christmas!&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your &#34;
 &#39;family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that&#39;s all.&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I &#39;
 &#34;still wouldn&#39;t help you. &#34;,
 &#34;HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren&#39;t gonna buy us presents for &#34;
 &#39;Christmas!&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;No! No, this can&#39;t be happening! &#34;,
 &#39;You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!&#39;,
 &#34;Everyone&#39;s gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of &#34;
 &#39;buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  &#39;
 &#39;AAAAAA!! &#39;,
 &#34;It wasn&#39;t enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill &#34;
 &#39;Christmas too, huh?!&#39;,
 &#34; This is it, Kyle. You and me. We&#39;re throwin&#39; down. Right now.&#34;,
 &#39;You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?&#39;,
 &#34;Fine. But if it doesn&#39;t work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once &#34;
 &#39;and for all.&#39;,
 &#39;We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be &#39;
 &#39;back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to &#39;
 &#39;buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.&#39;,
 &#39;Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! &#39;,
 &#39;Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh Jesus Christ.&#39;,
 &#39;Which road?!&#39;,
 &#39; Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us &#39;
 &#39;presents IF we hurry. &#39;,
 &#34;But if you don&#39;t mind, we&#39;re in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We&#39;re running out of time!&#34;,
 &#39;How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.&#39;,
 &#39; How could you be so stupid!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we &#39;
 &#34;were gonna throw down!  Well it&#39;s on! We&#39;re gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! &#34;,

 &#34; Well come on, let&#39;s hurry! It&#39;s almost Christmas! &#34;,
 &#34;And... I&#39;m not going to get any Christmas presents. &#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m gonna kill you, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Christmas. We officially missed it. It&#39;s Christmas Day and ... I&#39;m in &#34;
 &#39;Canada.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn&#39;t get any presents!  And what &#34;
 &#34;did I tell you, Kyle?!  I told you that if we didn&#39;t make it back in time &#34;
 &#34;for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn&#39;t I?! &#34;,
 &#34;Well now you&#39;re gonna get it, motherfucker! That&#39;s right! You and me! Right &#34;
 &#34;now!  We&#39;re havin&#39; it out! Let&#39;s go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! &#34;
 &#39;Moooooooom!&#39;,
 &#39;Pfaha, so funny. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. We won&#39;t have to take crap from anybody.&#34;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s gonna tell them, dumbass?!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There&#39;s something even you can &#34;
 &#39;afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.&#39;,
 &#39;Parents? Parents??  Oh God! &#39;,
 &#39;Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why!  Why?! &#39;,
 &#34;Giya! Shut up, hippies! I&#39;ll kill you!  Iya!&#34;,
 &#39; Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to &#39;
 &#39;eradicating the world of hippies&#39;,
 &#39;Kick ass! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to &#39;
 &#34;Craig and those guys. They&#39;ll be so jealous.&#34;,
 &#34;Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can&#39;t be ninjas! They&#39;ve got no spine!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson&#39;s movie, The Passion, and Mel &#34;
 &#39;Gibson says you are a sloth and you are a liar. And if the Road Warrior says &#39;
 &#39;it, it must be true.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. &#39;,
 &#39; Look what we got.&#39;,
 &#39; Oooh, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the &#39;
 &#39;sweet water of your envy.&#39;,
 &#39;Ugh.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!&#39;,
 &#34;Ho man, did you see the look on Craig&#39;s face?! That was awesome!&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re playing Ninjas, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the &#39;
 &#34;world from evil, and you can&#39;t play with us.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, and no time to do it. No time... &#39;,
 &#39;Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future &#39;
 &#39;too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.&#39;,
 &#39;I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.&#39;,
 &#39;I have the power to have all the powers I want.&#39;,
 &#34; C&#39;mon!&#34;,
 &#39;Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!&#34;,
 &#39;All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle &#39;
 &#39;took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight &#39;
 &#39;this evil villain!&#39;,
 &#39;All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! &#39;
 &#39;Bleh! &#39;,
 &#39;Hahahahahaaa ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, fuck dude!&#39;,
 &#39;Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay &#39;
 &#39;calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in &#39;
 &#34;Kyle&#39;s backyard.&#34;,
 &#34;Go ahead and scramble it, then he won&#39;t remember it was us.&#34;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come &#34;
 &#34;on guys, sure, it&#39;s easy to be a ninja when everything&#39;s going your way, but &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true &#34;
 &#39;character.&#39;,
 &#34;Shut up, Butters.  Now, there&#39;s a way out of this. We just have to use &#34;
 &#39;our... ninja reasoning. &#39;,
 &#39;Dr. Shafley?&#39;,
 &#39;So if we make Butters up to look like a dog,...&#39;,
 &#39;I need the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. &#39;,
 &#34;Butters! We&#39;re trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an &#34;
 &#39;asshole!&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, let&#39;s hear your bark, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet&#39;s office, you need to stay &#34;
 &#34;down on all fours and- Butters, listen!! At the vet&#39;s office, you need to &#34;
 &#39;stay down on all fours and bark a lot.&#39;,
 &#39;In here! &#39;,
 &#39;No way, you got weapons too??&#39;,
 &#39;Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!&#39;,
 &#34; We&#39;re twice the ninjas you fags are!&#34;,
 &#39;Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we&#39;re gonna tell on &#34;
 &#34;you, and that&#39;s the ninja code!&#34;,
 &#39;Here, Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Butter-Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Here, Butters!&#39;,
 &#39; Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchakus away. If you can. But you know &#39;
 &#34;well that your Jewish blood won&#39;t let you. You can&#39;t throw away something &#34;
 &#39;you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.&#39;,
 &#39;Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screamig &#34;NO! Those &#39;
 &#39;cost money! Get your money back!&#34; You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove &#39;
 &#39;Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it! &#39;,
 &#39;All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.&#39;,
 &#39;I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.  This way, I can &#39;
 &#39;move about the crowd of people undetected.  Here, hold this stuff for me.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, fuck you, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.&#39;,
 &#39;I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. I will be your new best friend.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In face, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most &#39;
 &#39;personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to &#39;
 &#39;other people and stuff.&#39;,
 &#39;Could be.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.&#39;,
 &#34; That, that&#39;s very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, really?&#39;,
 &#39;Heh. Wow, that sucks.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.&#39;,
 &#39;Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;You saw that?&#39;,
 &#39;Nuh uh.&#39;,
 &#39;No way.&#39;,
 &#39; ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and &#39;
 &#39;stuff. I am AWESOM-O.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, son of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O does not have a mom.&#39;,
 &#34; Grrr. Jesus Christ I can&#39;t go on like this.  Butters, remember when you &#34;
 &#39;said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?&#39;,
 &#39;I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I &#39;
 &#39;see the video?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.&#39;,
 &#39;...No way.&#39;,
 &#39;Weak! &#39;,
 &#39;Lame!&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.&#39;,
 &#39;Where is it? Where is it??&#39;,
 &#39;Wah!&#39;,
 &#39;Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O understands.&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!&#39;,
 &#39;I would like some Sunny Delight too.&#39;,
 &#39; AWESOM-O will answers the door. &#39;,
 &#34; Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I&#39;m a robot for a little while &#34;
 &#39;longer.&#39;,
 &#34;Because I need to, all right?! I&#39;ve got something planned that&#39;s uh gonna be &#34;
 &#39;really sweet. Just play along, okay?&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?&#39;,
 &#39; Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;Weak.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, of course. &#39;,
 &#39;Suck mah balls, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39;Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Lame.&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you. &#39;,
 &#39;Aw-Aw-AWESOM-O is coming. &#39;,
 &#39;Argh! &#39;,
 &#34;Butters, wouldn&#39;t you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could &#34;
 &#39;meet up later, perhaps?&#39;,
 &#39;The New Orleans Saints. &#39;,
 &#39;Seventeen. &#39;,
 &#39;Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, &#39;
 &#39;but then it turns out that the girl is actually a ...golden retriever, or &#39;
 &#39;something.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but &#39;
 &#39;first, he has to, like, become a ...boxer, or something.&#39;,
 &#34;You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;ideas.&#39;,
 &#39; Haaaa! Haaaa!&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.&#39;,
 &#39;Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is &#39;
 &#39;trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.&#39;,
 &#39;...What?&#39;,
 &#39;AWESOM-O does not understand.&#39;,
 &#39; LAME!&#39;,
 &#39;NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME! &#39;,
 &#39;Waaaaa! &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!&#39;,
 &#34;Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can&#39;t I move?!&#34;,
 &#34;The fuck are you talkin&#39; about, dude?!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not a robot, dumbass! I&#39;m alive!&#34;,
 &#34;I said I&#39;m a real person, asswipe!&#34;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, get me down from here! &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not a robot, I&#39;m a human!&#34;,
 &#39;Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, &#39;
 &#39;Colorado!&#39;,
 &#34; Goddamnit, stop! I&#39;m real! I&#39;m real!&#34;,
 &#34;Aw, it&#39;s about freaking time, jackass! &#34;,
 &#39;No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! &#39;,
 &#39;I am the AWESOM-O 4000. &#39;,
 &#39;Uh... now ending fart sequence.&#39;,
 &#39;Smell sequence initiated.&#39;,
 &#39; Would you like to touch my body? Come on and touch my body! Oooo, my hot &#39;

 &#39;just like ??? Come on Justin, touch my body!  Mmm, Justin, yeah! Touch my &#39;
 &#39;body! You and me! Check it out, my not-hot body! Come on, my body!&#39;,
 &#39;Lame...&#39;,
 &#34; The Special Olympics? What&#39;s so special about them?&#34;,
 &#39; Dude, what?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude. I can&#39;t believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, &#34;
 &#39;making them compete against each other just for our amusement. &#39;,
 &#39;What? What did I do?&#39;,
 &#34; YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS! I have the best idea ever! I&#39;m gonna be rich!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this &#39;
 &#39;shit out: &#34;At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special &#39;
 &#39;Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;So?? So dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally &#39;
 &#39;handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand &#39;
 &#39;bucks!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s flawless! I&#39;ll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to &#34;
 &#34;compete I&#39;ll kick ass against all the handicappeds!&#34;,
 &#34;Terrible?? Whatever! You guys&#39;s brains just can&#39;t compute complex plans like &#34;
 &#34;mine can! It&#39;ll work, you&#39;ll see. &#34;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#34;What are you gonna do, Kyle? Tell on me?  Then you&#39;ll be a great big no-good &#34;
 &#39;double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!  Is that really how you deal with your &#39;
 &#34;problems?! Grow up, Kyle!  All I have to do is make people think I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won&#39;t be easy, but nothing &#34;
 &#39;worth having ever is.&#39;,
 &#34;Darrrr. Durrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull&#39;s eye!&#34;,
 &#34;Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what&#39;s going on? Drrrrrt.&#34;,
 &#39;You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand &#39;
 &#34;dollars is just four days away.  I&#39;m going to go sign up now.&#34;,
 &#39;What?? &#39;,
 &#39;Moooommmmm?&#39;,
 &#39;Um, could I get you to do something for me?&#39;,
 &#34;Um, okay. This is goin&#39; ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. &#34;
 &#39;Um, moommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special &#39;
 &#39;Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollare? &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not special? I thoght you always said I was special.&#34;,
 &#34;...I&#39;ll split the money with you. &#34;,
 &#34; All right, Mom, look. Here&#39;s ...the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to &#34;
 &#34;say.  I think, Mom, that I&#39;ve been hard on some of the handicapped kids at &#34;
 &#34;school in the past. I&#39;ve sometimes looked at people with disabilities as &#34;
 &#34;people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I&#39;m starting to &#34;
 &#39;think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes, ...if I could &#39;
 &#34;just see the challenges they face every day, ...mauye I wouldn&#39;t be so cold. &#34;
 &#39;I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome.&#39;,
 &#39; Naaaa! Daaaaa!&#39;,
 &#39;Naaaa!&#39;,
 &#39;Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!&#39;,
 &#34;...How should I know? I&#39;m retarded. Daaaaa!&#34;,
 &#39;How I Will Spend My One Thousand Dollars By Eric Cartman  Enter! &#39;,
 &#39;Go on, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, Kyle, I understand where you&#39;re coming from, and I appreciate you &#34;
 &#39;being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on &#39;
 &#34;morality because you&#39;re Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven&#39;t gone to see Mel &#34;
 &#34;Gibson&#39;s film, The Passion but-&#34;,
 &#39;Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is &#39;
 &#34;reserved for the Jews, and all those who don&#39;t accept Christ. That being the &#34;
 &#39;case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the &#39;
 &#39;beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. &#39;,
 &#39;One thousand dollars, yeah!&#39;,
 &#39; Daaaa! Daaaa!&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa. What the hell?? &#39;,
 &#34;Well, guess I&#39;ll, guess I&#39;ll just have to kick ass in the other events.&#34;,
 &#39; God-damnit!!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I&#39;ll show you Goddamned &#34;
 &#39;retards! &#39;,
 &#39;God-damnit!!&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, screw you hippie!&#39;,
 &#34;...I could pile at Shakey&#39;s, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!&#34;,
 &#39; Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.&#39;,
 &#39;Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like &#39;
 &#39;a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy &#39;
 &#39;could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! Well, well you guys &#39;
 &#39;are assholes!  Grow up! &#39;,
 &#39; Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet &#39;
 &#39;Omega Nine.&#39;,
 &#39;What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?&#39;,
 &#34;All right, hang on. We&#39;re about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and &#34;
 &#39;Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait &#39;
 &#39;here.&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s my Mom&#39;s new minivan, so I&#39;m the captain, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#39;Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t hold me responsible.&#34;,
 &#39;Set phasers on stun.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. A little too quiet.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, fine, I guess we&#39;ll look for- Oh no!! Look out!! It&#39;s a giant &#34;
 &#39;four-headed lava frog!! Shoot it!!  Oh no, it got Kyle!!&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, it got Kyle and it&#39;s tearing his head off!!  Aw you guys, it looks like &#34;
 &#39;Kyle is done for.&#39;,
 &#34;Agh! You see guys, this is why you don&#39;t bring Jews along on the away team: &#34;
 &#34;they don&#39;t play along!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson&#39;s movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the &#34;
 &#39;movie, Jews are the Devil!&#39;,
 &#34;How do you know?! I&#39;ve seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You &#34;
 &#34;haven&#39;t seen it once! There&#39;s even one part where the Jews have a chance to &#34;
 &#39;save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, &#39;
 &#39;go free instead and laugh about it.&#39;,
 &#39;Go see the movie, Kyle!!&#39;,
 &#34;You know what it is? You&#39;re scared. You&#39;re scared of the truth. You don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone &#39;
 &#39;hates you.&#39;,
 &#39; Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing &#39;
 &#34;film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don&#39;t lie. If you&#39;re not scared of The &#34;
 &#34;Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I&#39;m wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. &#34;
 &#39;Mel Gibson.&#39;,
 &#39;Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the &#39;
 &#39;shuttlecraft! &#39;,
 &#39;Mom! Doorbell!&#39;,
 &#39; Mom! Answer the door!&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay, Kyle. It&#39;s okay. Just... say that first part again?&#34;,
 &#39; Mmm, one more time, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have &#39;
 &#39;shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my &#39;
 &#39;dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you &#39;
 &#39;for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the &#39;
 &#39;courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate &#39;
 &#39;my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the &#39;
 &#39;masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.&#39;,
 &#34;Mel Gibson&#39;s The Passion Fan Club.&#34;,
 &#39;Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at &#39;
 &#39;5:30 p.m.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don&#39;t understand what Mel Gibson &#34;
 &#39;was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and &#39;
 &#39;filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their &#39;
 &#39;eyes.&#39;,
 &#34;If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I&#39;d be down on the floor licking his balls &#34;
 &#39;at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now &#39;
 &#34;stop wasting me and Mel Gibson&#39;s time, you little wussy prick.&#34;,
 &#34;Ohoh yeah?! I&#39;d like to see you try, asshole! I&#39;m like six feet tall!&#34;,
 &#34;Bitch?! Don&#39;t call me bitch! I&#39;ll pop your fuckin&#39; head open!&#34;,
 &#39;I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and &#39;
 &#39;opened it, bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;Eup. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah Mom, I&#39;m holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as &#34;
 &#39;much as I did.&#39;,
 &#34; Tell them I&#39;ll be down shortly&#34;,
 &#39; Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind! &#39;
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;m ready. I&#39;m ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. &#34;,
 &#34;Ah hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I&#39;m the President &#34;
 &#34;of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I&#39;m happy to see that &#34;
 &#39;all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why &#39;
 &#34;we&#39;re here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.&#34;,
 &#34;But, I think it&#39;s best we don&#39;t talk out loud about it until we have most of &#34;
 &#39;them on the trains heading to the camps. &#39;,
 &#39; Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs &#39;
 &#39;to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all &#39;
 &#39;go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.&#39;,
 &#39;One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud &#39;
 &#39;few gathere here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans &#39;
 &#39;of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power &#39;
 &#39;to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march &#39;
 &#39;in unwavering support of this important movie!&#39;,
 &#39;And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support! So, when I &#39;
 &#39;say &#34;Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,&#34; you all chant back &#34;Wir müssen die Juden &#39;
 &#39;ausrotten.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! &#39;,
 &#39;Es ist Zeit für Rache!&#39;,
 &#39; All right, everyone! Forward, march!  Es ist Zeit für Rache!&#39;,
 &#39;Es ist Zeit für Rache!&#39;,
 &#39;Nice.&#39;,
 &#39; Es ist Zeit für Rache! &#39;,
 &#39;Es ist Zeit für Rache!&#39;,
 &#39;Es ist Zeit für Rache!&#39;,
 &#39; Juden!&#39;,
 &#34;Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You&#39;re actually here! Mr. Gibson, &#34;
 &#39;I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a &#39;
 &#39;good boy, Mr. Gibson?!&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we&#39;re so close to completing my final solution!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. &#39;,
 &#34;HA! You just got f&#39;d in the a!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;All right!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, Butters! &#39;,
 &#34; Hel-lo ma&#39;am. We&#39;re going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. &#34;
 &#39;Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand &#39;
 &#39;dollars?&#39;,
 &#34;Ooo, ouch, ma&#39;am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! &#34;
 &#34;Ten dollars, you&#39;re breaking my balls, ma&#39;am!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a deal! All right, guys, let&#39;s get to work!  Yeah, it&#39;s so totally &#34;
 &#34;awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;goin&#39; on over there? Yeah, that&#39;s pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, &#34;
 &#39;that is so weak.  What?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m takin&#39; a break.&#34;,
 &#34;Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I&#39;m the negotiator. I &#34;
 &#39;negotiate our price with the customers.&#39;,
 &#34;It works, doesn&#39;t it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?&#34;,
 &#34;Hey! Don&#39;t boss me around, you fuckin&#39; Jew! I will kick your ass!&#34;,
 &#39;Shoveling accident.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I&#39;d totally let you have &#34;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#39;What?? Who??&#39;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t understand you, asshole! &#34;,
 &#34;Look, it&#39;s working! &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having &#39;
 &#39;sex with each other.&#39;,
 &#34;I hope they&#39;re not Austrians. That&#39;s the last thing this town needs. &#34;,
 &#39; No.&#39;,
 &#34;Your name is Blanket. Right. Well, Blanket, I&#39;m Howdy Doody, and these are &#34;
 &#39;my friends Timsy , Winky  and Nod.  Unfortunately, we have to be off to the &#39;
 &#34;Land of Booger Trees, so we&#39;ll be leaving now. &#34;,
 &#34; Huh look dude, we&#39;re in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? &#34;
 &#34;It means we don&#39;t hang out with a little kid. Come on, guys, let&#39;s get back &#34;
 &#39;to our Big Wheels. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God, this is awesome! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest dad in the world!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn&#39;t my house like this?!&#34;,
 &#34; They&#39;re a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named &#34;
 &#39;Blanket, and he has the coolest dad in the world! &#39;,
 &#39;They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, &#39;
 &#39;and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?? Guess. A &#39;
 &#39;train.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah way, Craig! And if you don&#39;t believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can &#34;
 &#39;just not come!&#39;,
 &#39;Choo-choo train! Yay! &#39;,
 &#34; Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You&#39;re so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.&#39;,
 &#39;... Train together&#39;,
 &#34;... I&#39;ve got time. Do youuu??&#34;,
 &#39;Choo-choo train.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!&#39;,
 &#39;You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park &#39;
 &#39;with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with &#39;
 &#34;it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that&#39;s happened to this town in a long &#34;
 &#39;time, and if you miss this up, so help me GOD, I will rip your balls off &#39;
 &#39;with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! &#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!&#39;,
 &#39;He is MY friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  &#39;
 &#34;and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I&#39;m serisouslih! You&#39;d better not be talking bad &#34;
 &#39;about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#34;tell you what you&#39;re doing! You&#39;re trying to steal MY best friend!&#34;,
 &#39;Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. &#39;,
 &#34; Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;awesome.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah? &#39;,
 &#34;Not go to Mr. Jefferson&#39;s anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but &#34;
 &#39;you can suck my fat hairy balls! &#39;,
 &#34;Mr. Jefferson? It&#39;s your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. &#34;
 &#39;Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Jefferson, hello??&#39;,
 &#34; No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I&#39;ve been &#34;
 &#39;hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests &#39;
 &#34;children, that he&#39;s a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!&#34;,
 &#34;Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson&#39;s a little different. But that&#39;s because he had to &#34;
 &#34;work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.&#39;,
 &#34;Goddamnit PETAns piss me off! We&#39;re never gonna end up with a stupid eagle &#34;
 &#39;or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.&#39;,
 &#39;Ye-heah!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeh- no, no, wait wait wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do &#39;
 &#39;is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not &#39;
 &#39;check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in &#34;Turd &#39;
 &#39;Sandwich.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Heh, it&#39;s only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We &#34;
 &#39;have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be soo funny!&#39;,
 &#39;IT IS NOT!!!&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, you&#39;re just saying that because I broke your cat&#39;s leg last week.&#34;,
 &#39; ...Wait wait, what about Butters?&#39;,
 &#34;Goddamnit you guys, Butters is our friend! And he&#39;s allowed to have his &#34;
 &#39;opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a &#39;
 &#39;super funny turd sandwich?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.&#34;,
 &#39;A turd sandwich.&#39;,
 &#39;Turd sandwich.&#39;,
 &#39;Turd sandwich.&#39;,
 &#39;AWWWW!!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. You win, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;All right turd sandwich!&#39;,
 &#39;Giant Douche sucks!&#39;,
 &#39;Dream on, Jew boy!&#39;,
 &#39;Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  &#39;
 &#39;Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote &#39;
 &#39;for Tomorrow!&#39;,
 &#39; Hello, Clyde.&#39;,
 &#34;We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school&#39;s new &#34;
 &#39;mascot.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh really? Well that&#39;s interesting. You certainly should think about it and &#34;
 &#39;make the right decision.  Butterscotch candy?&#39;,
 &#39;Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?&#39;,
 &#39;You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete &#39;
 &#39;package. The turd and the coin. And the lettuce, and the olives.&#39;,
 &#34;So, come voting day, you&#39;ll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?&#34;,
 &#39;Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? &#39;,
 &#34; Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don&#39;t let them intimidate you, Stan. I&#39;ll help walk &#34;
 &#34;you to the booth. And then I&#39;m gonna buy you a niiice steak dinner with all &#34;
 &#39;the trimmings.&#39;,
 &#34;Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! It&#39;s an obvious suck-up move.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh no! NOOO!!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your &#39;
 &#39;pants.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah?! I&#39;ll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, &#34;
 &#39;asshole!&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, awesome!&#39;,
 &#39; Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!&#39;,
 &#39;Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty &#39;
 &#39;bucks!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you can&#39;t shop for crap. &#34;,
 &#34;Excuse me! Hello! Can somebody tell my why we&#39;re going to Jim&#39;s Drugs to buy &#34;
 &#39;Voltar cards when Wall*Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?&#39;,
 &#39;What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s called progress, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39;... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall*Mart. It was only five &#39;
 &#39;bucks. &#39;,
 &#39; Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn&#39;t you?&#34;,
 &#34;No, but YOU got everyone all worked up! You&#39;re jealous of the Wall*Mart. You &#34;
 &#39;always hated it.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, awesome! &#39;,

 &#39; I did not! I wanna close Wall*Mart just as much as you guys do!&#39;,

 &#39;You speak too much, sir!&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s ten bucks you owe me, dickface!&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m afraid not, Kyle! Wall*Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools &#34;

 &#39;Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  No, Kenny. Kenny! Knock it off.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey gaybots, what&#39;s goin&#39; on?&#34;,
 &#34;Really? That&#39;s cool. When did-?  What did you say?  Trent Boyett? Meanest, &#34;
 &#39;dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at US Trent Boyett??&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, Holy Jesus, God is...&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s true.&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.&#34;,
 &#34;Jews can&#39;t be firemen.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t call me fat, you stupid Jew!&#34;,
 &#39;But how do we start a fire?&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Trent.&#34;,
 &#34;Shut up, Butters! We know what we&#39;re doing!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, we didn&#39;t start the fire, Trent Boyett did.&#34;,
 &#39;Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.&#39;,
 &#34;Whatever. That&#39;s like five years from now.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh Jesus, he&#39;s gonna kill us. We-we&#39;ve gotta tell our parents!&#34;,
 &#34;You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you&#39;ve forgotten, Trent &#34;
 &#34;Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He&#39;s gonna tear us apart!&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got to tell them who did this, you guys. We&#39;re gonna get it as bad as &#34;
 &#39;Butters!&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe you didn&#39;t hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!&#34;,
 &#39;How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, heh. &#39;,
 &#39; A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots &amp; Ladders game used only three times, &#39;
 &#39;DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase &#39;
 &#39;of any deloxe hamburger at Red Robin.  All this can be yours. &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan&#39;s mom naked. Cool.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture &#34;
 &#39;of my hot breasts.&#39;,
 &#39;Nononono, you gotta go  &#34;But Mo-o-o-om.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; &#34;But Mo-o-o-om.&#34;&#39;,

 &#34;Yeah, but Stan&#39;s mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the &#34;
 &#39;bottom now.&#39;,

 &#39;All right!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys, we&#39;re free! We haven&#39;t a care in the world!&#34;,

 &#39;AAAAAAAAH!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, our conscious got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell &#39;
 &#39;everyone the truth. &#39;,
 &#39;Stay away from us, Trent!&#39;,

 &#39;I am NOT going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!&#39;,

 &#34;Right. We should make up stories, because they&#39;ll be far more interesting.&#34;,
 &#39;Gosh, Butters, write that down!&#39;,
 &#39;And panda bears for the preschoolers.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re in fourth grade, Timmy. We don&#39;t even know what ethical means.&#34;,
 &#39;Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I, I know the &#39;
 &#39;guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing &#39;
 &#39;is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.&#39;,
 &#39;You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... &#39;
 &#34;Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That&#39;s why all &#34;
 &#39;African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... &#39;
 &#39;white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to &#39;
 &#34;hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There&#39;s no &#34;
 &#34;shame in it, and I think it&#39;ll really help our ratings.&#34;,
 &#39;Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. &#39;
 &#39;But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!&#39;,
 &#39;And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope &#39;
 &#34;there&#39;s no tornadoes headed our way.&#34;,
 &#34; Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the jinx on some students&#39; &#34;
 &#39;bathroom habits. Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39; One testicle!  What an asshole! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let&#39;s get a look at the celebrity &#34;
 &#39;scene shot, with Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school &#39;
 &#34;cafeteria, we&#39;re goin&#39; to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make &#34;
 &#39;out with Susan Farkle.&#39;,
 &#34;Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don&#39;t know &#34;
 &#34;how we&#39;re gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who&#39;s got &#34;
 &#39;Skidmark Monday.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s boring news, Jimmy.&#34;,
 &#39;All right, tell me about it.&#39;,
 &#34; Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I&#39;m sorry, what were we talking about?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh man, this is sooo great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh &#39;
 &#34;come&#39;ere you! &#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!&#34;,
 &#39;How about we have us, um... hmmm.&#39;,
 &#34;Wait, I&#39;ve got it.  Crab people.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.&#34;,
 &#39; Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!&#39;,
 &#39;How about we do a show where we kill Butters? &#39;,
 &#34;We have crab people. Just sayin&#39;.&#34;,
 &#39;That sounds perfect.&#39;,
 &#34; Huh. I don&#39;t have any ideas yet.&#34;,
 &#39; Stan, are you getting good ideas?&#39;,
 &#34; Stan? Stan, come on. We&#39;re gonna go find a frog. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh Stan, I just got the best idea&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, this TV show is awesome.&#39;,
 &#39;Ah I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. &#39;,
 &#39; They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remiedy. But behind &#39;
 &#39;closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Hoochie, &#39;
 &#34;wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I&#39;m Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy &#34;
 &#39;Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of &#39;
 &#39;cough medicine abuse.&#39;,
 &#34;And now, for a quick celebrity check, here&#39;s Butters Stotch.&#34;,
 &#39; Haha! In your face, Craig!&#39;,
 &#34;This sucks. I don&#39;t wanna keep havin&#39; to come up with ideas for shows all &#34;
 &#39;the time. It hurts my head. &#39;,
 &#39;...I think bail.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Dude, there\&#39;s Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.&#34;  Fuck &#39;
 &#39;you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, &#39;
 &#39;and fuck you, bitch! &#39;,
 &#34; Oh, hey, What&#39;s goin&#39; on? I&#39;m uh, here for the party.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh uh uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.&#39;,
 &#39;Kelly Rutherford Menskin.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh wait wait wait, aah it wasn&#39;t her. That&#39;s right, I forgot, it was uh... &#34;
 &#39;Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter&#39;,
 &#39; Oh Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#39;This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.&#39;,
 &#39; ...Geez, this looks a lot higher from up here.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. &#39;
 &#39;On this historic day, let us go on to&#39;,
 &#34;And now, again, one man&#39;s vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, &#34;
 &#39;proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! &#39;,
 &#39;Eugh... &#39;,
 &#39;Wheh? Where am I?&#39;,
 &#39;Coma... How long?&#39;,
 &#39;Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients? This is &#39;
 &#39;bullcrap!&#39;,
 &#39;Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!&#39;,
 &#39;Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!&#39;,
 &#39;Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, I just knew it.  Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!&#34;,
 &#39;How come the outline is missing its hand?&#39;,
 &#39;Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He &#39;
 &#34;... He&#39;s taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make &#34;
 &#39;Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!&#39;,
 &#39;Guess again.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers. You don&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, didn&#39;t you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the &#34;
 &#39;serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! &#39;,
 &#39;Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?&#39;,
 &#39;Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single &#34;
 &#39;thoght!&#39;,
 &#39;Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! &#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they &#34;
 &#34;absolutely are for sale. Let&#39;s go!&#34;,
 &#39;No. Nothing.&#39;,
 &#34;Wait a minute.  Fried chicken. It&#39;s tender and it&#39;s fresh.  There&#39;s maple &#34;
 &#34;syrup... Maple syrup&#39;s being put on the chicken.&#34;,
 &#34;It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It&#39;s a fried chicken sundae.&#34;,
 &#34;If I&#39;m happy and I know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap* If I&#39;m happy and I &#34;
 &#39;know it, clap my hands. *clap* *clap* &#39;,
 &#34;More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it&#39;s so very &#34;
 &#39;tiring.&#39;,
 &#39;Proper channels?&#39;,
 &#34;I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn&#39;t need to go to Psychic &#34;
 &#39;Detective School.&#39;,
 &#39; Ten percent my balls, get lost!&#39;,
 &#34;Stand back, mother! We&#39;re having a telekinetic battle of minds!&#34;,
 &#39;In court?&#39;,
 &#39;Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?&#39;,
 &#34;... &#39;K. Sweet.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there&#39;s some homeless guy &#34;
 &#39;here. Make him go away. &#39;,
 &#34;Hey. Hey, what&#39;s goin&#39; on??&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t even know you dude!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh Jesus.&#39;,
 &#34;No! No, you don&#39;t wanna kill me. Please, I&#39;ll give you anything you want!&#34;,
 &#39; Heheh.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes yes, I see! &#39;,
 &#39;AAAAAAAH!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God! I&#39;m so bored! Somebody help me! &#34;,
 &#39;(Hey! Come over here!)&#39;,
 &#39; (Hey! Get me out of here!) &#39;,
 &#34;No, please! I&#39;m sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it &#34;
 &#39;was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them &#39;
 &#39;arrested.&#39;,
 &#34;Please just let me go! Ah I&#39;m gonna tell everyone I&#39;m not really psychic! &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ve learned my lesson! Please, I don&#39;t wanna-  I don&#39;t wanna have to use my &#34;
 &#39;psychic mind missile on you! &#39;,
 &#39;You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely &#39;
 &#39;jealous of my incredible psychic ability.&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t hurt me.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t believe anyone interrupted YOU when you read your Christmas story &#34;
 &#39;aloud, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?&#39;,
 &#39; All right, fine! Forget it! &#39;,
 &#34;Well, I guess we&#39;ll never know, because Kyle doesn&#39;t wanna hear how it ends.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not at all what happens.&#34;,
 &#39; &#34;Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?&#34; said the little boy &#39;
 &#39;in the red poofball hat.&#39;,
 &#34;This is ridiculous. Jews can&#39;t play basketball.&#34;,
 &#39;Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can&#39;t play basketball!&#34;,
 &#39;You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.&#34;,
 &#34;Hello, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do &#34;
 &#34;you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I&#39;m afraid you may have &#34;
 &#39;hippies.&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, they&#39;ve been poppin&#39; up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson &#34;
 &#39;next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  &#39;
 &#34;Hm, I don&#39;t like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma&#39;am.  See that? Hippies. &#34;,
 &#39;These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of &#39;
 &#39;hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, &#39;
 &#34;there&#39;s probably a whole lot more you&#39;re not seein&#39;. Uh, whe-where&#39;s the &#34;
 &#39;backyard.&#39;,
 &#34;Yep, that&#39;s what I thought. See that? You&#39;ve got a drum circle in your &#34;
 &#39;backyard. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson county. He had a little drum circle &#39;
 &#39;in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You &#39;
 &#39;get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a &#39;
 &#39;colony.&#39;,
 &#39; Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymerethane. The drum &#39;
 &#34;circle we&#39;re gonna have to gas.  Goddamnit! &#34;,
 &#39;Goddamn hippie! &#39;,
 &#39;Get out of here!&#39;,
 &#34;Ma&#39;am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-cricle &#34;
 &#34;hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they&#39;re gonna attract something much worse!&#34;,
 &#39;The college know-it-all hippies.&#39;,
 &#39; All right, in you go.&#39;,
 &#34;Get back. Get back or you&#39;re all gonna get maced! &#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s wrong is that there&#39;s more of you showing up every day and I need to &#34;
 &#39;find out why!&#39;,
 &#34;Brah, I&#39;m not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.&#34;,
 &#34;And you&#39;re gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here&#39;s some &#34;
 &#39;joints , and a guitar! &#39;,
 &#39;Please, I have to talk to you all right now!&#39;,
 &#34;Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don&#39;t give me a &#34;
 &#39;moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several &#34;
 &#34;days I&#39;ve been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to &#34;
 &#39;town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw &#39;
 &#39;this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. &#39;
 &#34;They&#39;re all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What &#34;
 &#34;this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They&#39;er thriving, if &#34;
 &#34;you will. I think that they&#39;re setting up for a... . hippie music festival.&#34;,
 &#34;Ti&#39;s, it&#39;s simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, &#34;
 &#39;it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, &#39;
 &#39;it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae &#39;
 &#39;on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to &#39;
 &#34;what we&#39;re looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we&#39;ve never &#34;
 &#39;seen. &#39;,
 &#34;I know hippies. I&#39;ve hated them all my life. I&#39;ve kept this town free of &#34;
 &#34;hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can&#39;t contain them on &#34;
 &#39;my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not potholes you need to worry about. It&#39;s potheads. I know what these &#34;
 &#39;people are capable of.&#39;,
 &#34;What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can&#39;t sweep this problem &#34;
 &#39;under the rug!  The town is in serious danger! &#39;,
 &#39;I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone &#39;
 &#34;pack up your crap, we&#39;re going to our basement!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their &#39;
 &#39;brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!&#39;,
 &#34;Listen, you&#39;re my friends, but if you&#39;ve been comprimised, I&#39;ll have no &#34;
 &#34;problem taking you out! I&#39;ll expect the same from you. &#34;,
 &#39;Everybody get in a single-file line!&#39;,
 &#34;Ah, Officer Barbrady, you&#39;re just in time. These college know-it-all hippies &#34;
 &#39;were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!&#39;,
 &#39;No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! &#39;
 &#39;Hebbiaaay! &#39;,
 &#39;What did I do?!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re not people, they&#39;re HIPPIES!&#34;,
 &#39; Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive &#39;
 &#39;jam band concert!&#39;,
 &#39; You... You what?&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re hippies! They don&#39;t HAVE any money! Does the city council know about &#34;
 &#39;this?!&#39;,
 &#39;You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!  That kid really needs some psychiatric help.&#39;,
 &#34; How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people&#39;s lives it it all worth?! &#34;
 &#39;GODDAMNED HIPPIE!&#39;,
 &#39; Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.&#39;,
 &#34; Let me guess: they&#39;ve started a hippie jam band music festival.&#34;,
 &#39; Forget it. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s too late! Even if I did agree to help, there&#39;s too many of them now!&#34;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it&#39;s the &#34;
 &#39;new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.&#39;,
 &#39;I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school &#39;
 &#39;parking lot.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes.  Kyle doesn&#39;t get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine &#34;
 &#39;around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I&#39;ve never tried to get &#34;
 &#34;rid of this many hippies before, so I&#39;m gonna need every resource this town &#34;
 &#34;has! And even if I don&#39;t succeed, and it&#39;s a million-to-one shot that I &#34;
 &#39;will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with &#39;
 &#39;it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get &#39;
 &#34;super-jealous because he doesn&#39;t have one! Are we clear?! &#34;,
 &#39;All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen &#39;
 &#39;miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.&#39;,
 &#39;In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My &#39;
 &#39;only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the &#39;
 &#39;heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into &#39;
 &#34;their music system.  Hippies can&#39;t stand death metal. If everything works, &#34;
 &#39;they should disperse just before they consume us all.&#39;,
 &#34;We drill.  I&#39;ve designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the &#34;
 &#39;densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and &#39;
 &#39;the crappy music outside.&#39;,
 &#39;Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along &#39;
 &#34;with me I&#39;m gonna need a scientest, an engineer, and of course, a black &#34;
 &#39;person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in &#39;
 &#39;case something goes wrong.  Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the &#39;
 &#34;qualifications, let&#39;s see...  Oh, I know. How about- &#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and &#34;
 &#34;operational in less than three days! Look, it&#39;s a long shot! But it&#39;s also &#34;
 &#39;the only shot we-  got.&#39;,
 &#34;I... don&#39;t want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You&#39;re the best &#34;
 &#34;stuffed animal I&#39;ve ever had. &#34;,
 &#39;Primary engine running?&#39;,
 &#39;Navigation systems?&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s punch this baby.  We&#39;re coming up on the outer perimeter of the &#34;
 &#39;hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?&#39;,
 &#34;Switching to secondary fuel line.  What&#39;s that?&#34;,
 &#39;Come on, come on!&#39;,
 &#34;No, Chef, I&#39;m not gonna let you go out there!&#34;,
 &#39;...All right, fine Chef, go!&#39;,
 &#39;Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re the scientist, jackass!&#34;,
 &#39;Put them in my laptop! &#39;,
 &#39;Hold it right there, Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.&#39;,
 &#39;Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with &#39;
 &#34;it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don&#39;t get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! &#34;
 &#39;Cooool!&#39;,
 &#34;Of course he sings. He&#39;s black.&#34;,
 &#39;You wanna know what it is, guys?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. We&#39;re not talented. See, we&#39;re not the artistic side, we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;the thinking side.&#39;,
 &#39; Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the &#39;
 &#34;top, right. I mean, he&#39;s gonna be a huge star.&#34;,
 &#34;So, why shouldn&#39;t we get some of that money? We can be Token&#39;s agents. That &#34;
 &#39;way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!&#39;,
 &#39;We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain &#39;
 &#39;in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta &#39;
 &#34;make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn&#39;t need us at all. &#34;,
 &#34;Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I&#39;ll bring Token there.&#34;,
 &#39;Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to &#39;
 &#39;the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.&#39;,
 &#34;Because I&#39;ll answer and pretend I&#39;m talking to somebody super famous and &#34;
 &#34;important. When Token sees that, maybe he&#39;ll think we&#39;re legit.&#34;,
 &#34; Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we&#39;re just not &#34;
 &#39;interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow &#39;
 &#39;night.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah I don&#39;t know if I ever told you this before, but I&#39;m actually an agent &#34;
 &#39;over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around &#39;
 &#34;town. Anyway, why don&#39;t you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can &#34;
 &#39;convince the company to represent you.&#39;,
 &#39;This will only take a second.&#39;,
 &#39;Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful &#39;
 &#39;company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this &#39;
 &#34;way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He&#39;s thinking about becoming a &#34;
 &#39;client.&#39;,
 &#39;Now, Token, I I know what you\&#39;re saying to yourself: You\&#39;re saying, &#34;Hey, &#39;
 &#39;why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?&#34; Right?&#39;,
 &#34; Token, the truth is that without representation, you&#39;re in danger of being &#34;
 &#39;taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome &#39;
 &#39;Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeahh, yeah, &#39;
 &#34;no, I&#39;m happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I&#39;m just sort of in the middle of &#34;
 &#39;something right now.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll I&#39;ll call you back, Abe. &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m making it look like important people call us.&#34;,
 &#34; ...well Token doesn&#39;t know that.&#34;,
 &#39;How?!&#39;,
 &#39;Jew! &#39;,
 &#34;Yes, yes, I think that&#39;s a good idea, guys. Let&#39;s give Michael Jordan a call &#34;
 &#39;about that.  Ah, now, where were we?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? &#39;,
 &#39;From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the &#39;
 &#39;singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to &#39;
 &#39;us.&#39;,
 &#34;We represent Token.  Give us a call, we&#39;ll work out a deal.&#34;,
 &#34;Two hundred dollars, Token, that&#39;s great! And ten percent of two hundred &#34;
 &#39;is...&#39;,
 &#39;Sweet!&#39;,
 &#39;You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.&#39;,
 &#39;Token, you signed with us!&#39;,
 &#34;What?! Uh they&#39;re not so great! They probably don&#39;t have a fountain in their &#34;
 &#39;lobby!&#39;,
 &#39;...Oooo...&#39;,
 &#39;...Goddamnit! &#39;,
 &#34;This just goes to show that hard work doesn&#39;t pay off! I&#39;m gonna be a &#34;
 &#39;homeless drug addict from now on! &#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve ...already done all the work?&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all &#34;
 &#39;the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. &#39;,
 &#39;Excuse us!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, how long is the wait?&#39;,
 &#34;Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That&#39;s my cell phone.  Hello? &#34;
 &#34;Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I&#39;m doing great, but you know, heh, &#34;
 &#34;someone at American Idol doesn&#39;t know who Wing is.&#34;,
 &#34;Eh eh, you&#39;re right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn&#39;t give her any more &#34;
 &#39;chicken.&#39;,
 &#39;Stupid assholes! &#39;,
 &#39;Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?&#39;,
 &#39;Come on, Wing!&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s got a hell of a chin on her, I&#39;ll give her that. &#34;,
 &#39;Gay.&#39;,
 &#39;Your gift of hope is a great deduction. &#39;,
 &#34;Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We&#39;re just sorry she wasn&#39;t a better boxer. &#34;,
 &#39;Four thousand dollars?? &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s four hundred for us! We did it! &#34;,
 &#39;Who let the dogs out?&#39;,
 &#39;Who let the dogs out?&#39;,
 &#39;Who let-?&#39;,
 &#39;Naw, sh-she was with you!&#39;,
 &#39; Wing? Wing??&#39;,
 &#39;Wing? Here, Wing!&#39;,
 &#39;Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency &#39;
 &#34;is! We&#39;re gonna march in there, and get our client back.&#34;,
 &#34;Of course it&#39;s impressive! They steal everyone else&#39;s clients!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! &#39;,
 &#39;Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t give us that crap! She&#39;s no good to you dead and you know it!&#34;,
 &#39;Aw aw guys, come on!&#39;,
 &#34;Token, you&#39;re... waiting tables?&#34;,
 &#34;Aw man, that&#39;s too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? &#34;
 &#39;Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! &#39;,
 &#39;Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!&#39;,
 &#39; Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. &#39;
 &#39;today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! &#39;,
 &#34;Everyone&#39;s moms are taking their kids after school! We&#39;re outsmarting &#34;
 &#34;everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let&#39;s go!&#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t wait to see the look on everyone&#39;s faces when I show up to school &#34;
 &#39;with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the &#39;
 &#39;hell?!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny, when did you get here?&#39;,
 &#34;Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I&#39;ll just... sort of get in here- in here. &#34;,
 &#39;Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Goddamnit!  They&#39;d better not sell out!&#34;,
 &#39;YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!&#39;,
 &#39;JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!&#39;,
 &#39;Fag!&#39;,
 &#39; Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?&#39;,
 &#34;Who cares? Kenny&#39;s dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?&#34;,
 &#39; Yes!&#39;,
 &#34;Well... well then he&#39;s NOT alive.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  &#34;
 &#39;Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn&#39;t wanna &#34;
 &#39;be kept alive via feeding tube.&#39;,
 &#39;Um, it was um, this one time...&#39;,
 &#39;Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that??  Uh I mean, I mean this &#39;
 &#34;isn&#39;t about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny &#34;
 &#34;said he didn&#39;t want to live like this!&#34;,
 &#39;Did so!&#39;,
 &#34;Fine! We&#39;ll see about this, you freakin&#39; Jew!  I&#39;m gonna get that feeding &#34;
 &#39;tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! &#39;,
 &#39;You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes &#39;
 &#39;to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive &#39;
 &#34;on a machine. What they&#39;re doing to him ...is not right.&#34;,
 &#34;I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny&#39;s... BFF.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  &#34;
 &#39;Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what &#39;
 &#39;that means, and how serious this is.&#39;,
 &#34; He&#39;s right in here.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. Respect our authoritih-m.&#34;,
 &#34;I believe the people at home see he&#39;s NOT in pain because he&#39;s a tomato!&#34;,
 &#39;You say Kenny, but I say tomato! &#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34; We&#39;re done! No more baseball!&#34;,
 &#39;All right, we did it! &#39;,
 &#39;Post-season?&#39;,
 &#34;Nobody told us if we win too many games we&#39;d go on to the finals!&#34;,
 &#39;All right, hit one out of the park!&#39;,
 &#39; Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.&#39;,
 &#39;All right! &#39;,
 &#39;Ball. Balll. &#39;,
 &#39;That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik &#39;
 &#39;surgery!&#39;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39; Aw Goddamnit! &#39;,
 &#34;How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he&#39;s going to first!&#34;,
 &#39;What happens if we win the State Championship game?&#39;,
 &#34;Wiat. I&#39;ve got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team &#34;
 &#39;always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.&#39;,
 &#39;Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our &#39;
 &#39;team, who totally sucks ass.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think so! You guys are way too good! You&#39;re the best at this game!&#34;,
 &#34; We&#39;re gonna lose! We&#39;re gonna lose!&#34;,
 &#39;Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! &#39;
 &#34;Now is she or isn&#39;t she?!&#34;,
 &#34;She&#39;s got Colonel!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh boy!&#39;,
 &#39;Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?&#39;,
 &#39;Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.&#39;,
 &#39; Well, I saved you all the chicken part. &#39;,
 &#34; Well, I gotta go home, guys. I&#39;m gonna sit on the toilet and read comic &#34;
 &#39;books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. &#39;,
 &#34; Hey fags, what&#39;s going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that &#34;
 &#39;chicken. I thought I was gonna die. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There&#39;s a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why &#34;
 &#39;Jews have glassy eyes?&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle?  Eh. K-Kenny, &#39;
 &#39;you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off?  Kenny? &#39;
 &#34;Kenny??  Stan? Stan, it&#39;s me, Eric!  Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty &#34;
 &#34;cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I&#39;m right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like &#34;
 &#34;they couldn&#39;t see or hear me. It&#39;s almost as if I were...  dead.  No. No, I &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t be dead.  I can&#39;t be dead!!&#34;,
 &#39;No! No!!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God, this can&#39;t be happening!  Mom? Mom&#39;s crying? Oh God, it is true!  &#34;
 &#34;Oh, it&#39;s not fair!  Why??? Why??? &#34;,
 &#34; Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I&#39;m here!  &#34;
 &#34;Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can&#39;t you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! &#34;
 &#34;Jimmy, it&#39;s me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can&#39;t you feel your hair move?! That&#39;s me!  &#34;
 &#34;They don&#39;t even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead &#34;
 &#39;and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.&#39;,
 &#39; What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I &#39;
 &#39;doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!&#39;,
 &#39;...What did you say?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters...  Butters! You can see me??&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God, and you can hear me??&#39;,
 &#34;Because, Butters, I&#39;m... dead. &#34;,
 &#39;Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!&#39;,
 &#39;I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, but you&#39;re the only one who can.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters...&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, you have to help me!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. &#39;,
 &#39; Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, Goddamnit, I&#39;m not in your imagination! I&#39;m dead and for some &#34;
 &#39;reason you can see me!&#39;,
 &#34;Get a hold of yourself! I&#39;m the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit &#34;
 &#34;is trapped here on Earth. I can&#39;t find the passage to Heaven.&#34;,
 &#39;What do you mean?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not going to Heck, Butters! I&#39;m not black, all right?!&#34;,
 &#39;Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure &#39;
 &#39;with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them &#39;
 &#39;through you.&#39;,
 &#39;This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for &#39;
 &#39;the rest of your life! &#39;,
 &#39; Tell her, tell her that I love her.&#39;,
 &#39; Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son &#39;
 &#39;sometimes!&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s just that, it&#39;s just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life &#34;
 &#34;tryin&#39; to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!&#34;,
 &#39;Just the good times.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t! Don&#39;t you understand?!&#34;,
 &#39;God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!&#39;,
 &#34; All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I&#39;m sorry for rippin&#39; &#34;
 &#34;on him for bein&#39; black. &#34;,
 &#34;Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That&#39;s eveyone, I &#34;
 &#34;guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I&#39;m sorry if I ever did &#34;
 &#39;anything to hurt you.&#39;,
 &#34; Well, it&#39;s all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, &#34;
 &#39;divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.&#39;,
 &#34; G&#39;bye Butters. I&#39;m goin&#39; to a better place. Perhaps I&#39;ll see you again &#34;
 &#39;sometime! Good-bye!! &#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?&#39;,
 &#39;What else do I have to do?!&#39;,
 &#39;Atone?&#39;,
 &#39; Not really...&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson&#39;s fence and never told him about it.&#34;,
 &#34;I took a crap in the principal&#39;s purse... seven times. Then there was the &#34;
 &#39;time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own &#39;
 &#34;Shakey&#39;s Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. &#34;
 &#39;I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uuh, oh yeah, and &#39;
 &#34;there&#39;s this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili &#34;
 &#39;which I fed to the kid.&#39;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#39;I know how.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, there&#39;s everything, Butters.  I&#39;ve made everything right.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It&#39;s time for me to leave.  &#34;
 &#39;Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  &#39;
 &#34;Goddamnit, what?! I&#39;ve made everything right!&#34;,
 &#39;I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think &#39;
 &#39;this is funny,..?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Butters, I&#39;m gonna get you out of here.&#34;,
 &#39;I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert &#39;
 &#39;in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s gonna close soon! Come on! &#34;,
 &#39;I told you, Butters. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I&#39;m here to stop. Come on, &#34;
 &#39;Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, Butters, I&#39;m going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in &#34;
 &#39;there, and then you go in and free the hostiages.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I have a plan. &#34;,
 &#34;They can&#39;t hurt me, Butters. I&#39;m already dead. &#34;,
 &#34;Yes, it&#39;s working! &#34;,
 &#39;Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.&#39;,
 &#39;My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal &#39;
 &#39;rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this &#39;
 &#34;whole thing, we&#39;ve really become friends.&#34;,
 &#34;We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I&#39;m gonna miss you.&#34;,
 &#34; Goodbye Buttters. I must be going now. I&#39;ll be looking down on you from &#34;
 &#39;time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbyyye! &#39;,
 &#39; You sonofabitch Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;You told me I was a ghost!&#39;,
 &#34;How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I&#39;m gonna get you back for &#34;
 &#34;this! I&#39;m going to  GET YOU BACK! &#34;,
 &#34;Hey, that&#39;s bullcrap?! How come Jimmy doesn&#39;t have to do it?!&#34;,
 &#39;No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. &#39;,
 &#39;Up yours, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you don&#39;t just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis &#34;
 &#39;in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some &#39;
 &#39;Italian food.&#39;,
 &#34;Sure, lots of times. I&#39;ve been laid, like, five thousand times.&#34;,
 &#39;I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her thnk &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re a good listener.&#34;,
 &#39;Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the &#39;
 &#34;date and wear an earpiece, and I&#39;ll be nearby, secretly telling you all the &#34;
 &#39;right things to say.&#39;,
 &#39; Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.&#39;,
 &#34; Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she&#39;s saying now isn&#39;t interesting at &#34;
 &#39;all, you say, &#34;Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; All right, when she stops yappin\&#39; again, say &#34;Wow, I\&#39;ve never thought of &#39;
 &#39;it that way before, but you\&#39;re right.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat &#39;
 &#39;whatever she said, and then follow it with &#34;Wow, how insightful.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.&#39;,
 &#39;Aaagh!&#39;,
 &#34; D&#39;you know what you are? You&#39;re all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You &#34;
 &#39;need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking &#39;
 &#39;finger and say &#34;That\&#39;s the bad guy!&#34; Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. Isn&#39;t this fun? Just you and me hangin&#39; out, Stan. No stupid Kyle &#34;
 &#39;around.&#39;,
 &#39;You know how?&#39;,
 &#39;Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.&#39;,
 &#34;Nobody&#39;s gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if &#34;
 &#34;anything happens, I&#39;ll take full responsibility.&#34;,
 &#39; Awesome.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re not moving.&#34;,
 &#39;Maybe you have the parking brake on.&#39;,
 &#39;Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!&#39;,
 &#39;Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! &#39;,
 &#39; Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy&#39;s boat I knew about.&#34;,
 &#34;Look, it&#39;s okay. We weren&#39;t here. This didn&#39;t happen, okay. We were both at &#34;
 &#39;my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta &#39;
 &#39;bail! &#39;,
 &#34; Dude, come on! We&#39;ve gotta get out of here! &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Shyeah, that was pretty funny.&#39;,
 &#34;Hehey, no no! We aren&#39;t the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver &#34;
 &#34;dam, okay?! That&#39;s their fault!&#34;,
 &#34;Well they should&#39;ve gotten out of there!&#34;,
 &#39;We did!&#39;,
 &#34;Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you&#39;re thinking, Stan. You&#39;re thinking, you&#39;er &#34;
 &#34;gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he&#39;s your best friend, but Kyle &#34;
 &#39;is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and &#39;
 &#39;he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!&#39;,
 &#39; Hngh, totally.&#39;,
 &#39; Aw crap!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey Stan.  Oh Goddamnit you told Kyle, didn&#39;t you?!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you&#39;re so caring, Kyle, why don&#39;t you &#34;
 &#39;share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!&#39;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle!  &#34;Oh, &#39;
 &#39;you\&#39;ve gotta help those people. It\&#39;s your responsibility.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Help! Help! &#39;,
 &#39;Not so fast, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Hand over the gold!&#39;,
 &#34;You know what I&#39;m talkng about!&#34;,
 &#39;All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don&#39;t intend to live in &#34;
 &#39;poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, &#39;
 &#39;Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;I want... your Jew gold! &#39;,
 &#34; Do you think I&#39;m stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold &#34;
 &#39;around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! &#39;
 &#39;Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! &#39;,
 &#39;...Aw man.&#39;,
 &#39; Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.&#39;,
 &#34; Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming.  We don&#39;t have a lot of time, so I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;cut to the chase: The girls at our school have been hiding something from &#39;
 &#39;us! Hiding something huge...&#39;,
 &#39;What if I were to tell you... that the girls have a device... which allows &#39;
 &#39;them to see... into the future?&#39;,
 &#34; Thank you, Clyde.  Aaaagh, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s true.  Uh, I secretly videotaped &#34;
 &#39;the girls on the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video &#39;
 &#39;camera.  I caught the following images on tape.  I warn you, these images &#39;
 &#39;may be too shocking for young children.&#39;,
 &#39;Video Playback Initialized! &#39;,
 &#39;Believe it! The girls can ask it any question they want and it gives them an &#39;
 &#39;answer. Freeze image!  Gemtemen, we have to get our hands on that device.&#39;,
 &#39; How is the incubation shield coming, Clyde?&#39;,
 &#39;Good man.  Any luck here?&#39;,
 &#39;Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  &#39;
 &#39;All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly &#39;
 &#34;complete. All that&#39;s left for us to do is get the device from the girls and &#34;
 &#39;bring it here.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand &#34;
 &#39;that technology over?&#39;,
 &#34;Heidi Turner  is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There&#39;s no &#34;
 &#39;doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If &#39;
 &#39;we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a &#39;
 &#39;hold of the device, but, find out how to use it.&#39;,
 &#39;No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up &#39;
 &#39;in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.&#39;,
 &#34;No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay?! It&#39;s way cooler than that!&#34;,
 &#34;Which is why we have to fake that boy&#39;s death. It&#39;s simple spy stuff, my &#34;
 &#39;friends. Take your top man, fake his deatk, then send him in disguised as &#39;
 &#39;the enemy. &#39;,
 &#34; Just keep stalling, Butters. We don&#39;t have the dead pig quite ready yet. &#34;,
 &#34;Okay, it&#39;s ready! Step down, Butters! &#34;,
 &#39;Okay. One! Two!&#39;,
 &#39;Nice.&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, I think it&#39;s totally working. The girls are totally buying it. &#34;,
 &#34; Dude, they totally think he&#39;s a girl. &#34;,
 &#34; Dude, they&#39;ve bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. &#34;,
 &#34;All right, Butters, that&#39;s Heidi&#39;s house.&#34;,
 &#34;Now Butters, we don&#39;t know exactly what it is that girls do at their slumber &#34;
 &#39;parties. But if they all start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.&#39;,
 &#39;Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at &#39;
 &#39;all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. &#39;,
 &#34;God only knows the horrors that go on in girls&#39; slumber parties. Let&#39;s just &#34;
 &#39;hope Butters can survive it.&#39;,
 &#39;That sonofabitch! &#39;,
 &#34;Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you&#39;re doing?!&#34;,
 &#34;You aren&#39;t there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be &#34;
 &#39;getting the future-telling device.&#39;,
 &#39;Working on what?! Your dance moves?!&#39;,
 &#39;Just do what you were sent in there to do, dickface! &#39;,
 &#34;Tango tango tango! We&#39;ve got it!  Let&#39;s get it to the cointainment center! &#34;
 &#39;Go! &#39;,
 &#39;Haaahahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! &#39;,
 &#39;Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of boy- and mankind! In a few &#39;
 &#39;moments, we will know the future. &#39;,
 &#34;No, no! We don&#39;t have tome for that, Stan! It&#39;s time to ask it a question.&#34;,
 &#39;Because I do, Clyde.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m askin&#39; the first question! Let&#39;s just start with something simple. Will &#34;
 &#34;Kyle die before he&#39;s twenty?&#34;,
 &#39;Will you all just shut up so I can do this?!&#39;,
 &#34;Are you guys nuts?! After everything we&#39;ve gone through?!&#34;,
 &#39;Think of the power!&#39;,
 &#34;Are we sure about this? We&#39;ll never know the future.&#34;,
 &#39;Damn, Ken!&#39;,
 &#39;I broke the egg.&#39;,
 &#39;I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, &#39;
 &#34;tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can&#39;t hide it, I &#34;
 &#39;broke the egg.&#39;,
 &#39;...No.&#39;,
 &#34;No. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the &#34;
 &#39;project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and &#39;
 &#39;she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out &#39;
 &#39;to C minus for both of us.&#39;,
 &#34;Damnit! I knew you&#39;d say that! You always have it out for me!&#34;,
 &#34; Mr. Garrison..., you&#39;ve never been this cool to me before.&#34;,
 &#39;...Why are you doing this?&#39;,
 &#39;What do you want from me?&#39;,
 &#39;...No.&#39;,
 &#39; Yes teacher.&#39;,
 &#39; Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.  My speech is entitled &#34;Ginger Kids: Children &#39;
 &#39;with red hair, light skin, and freckles.&#34;  We\&#39;ve all seen them - on the &#39;
 &#39;playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and &#39;
 &#34;make us feel sick to our stomachs. I&#39;m talking of course about... ginger &#34;
 &#39;kids.  Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes &#39;
 &#39;very light skin, red hair, and freckles.  Aw, nasty! Yuck!  This disease is &#39;
 &#39;called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.&#39;,
 &#39;Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured.  Ah sick!  Gross!  Yeck!  Because &#39;
 &#39;their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike...  &#39;
 &#39;vampires.&#39;,
 &#39;I was getting to that, if you will let me.  Some people have red hair, but &#39;
 &#39;not light skin and freckles. These people are called &#34;daywalkers.&#34; &#39;,
 &#34;Mrs. Garrison, I&#39;m really havin&#39; a difficult time with all these &#34;
 &#39;interruptions...&#39;,
 &#34;Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let&#39;s see, &#34;
 &#39;where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless &#39;
 &#39;we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives &#39;
 &#39;in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that &#39;
 &#39;gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: &#39;
 &#39;if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. &#39;,
 &#34;Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don&#39;t forget. Kyle is a daywalker. &#34;
 &#39;Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are &#39;
 &#39;evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got &#39;
 &#34;Jesus killed, that&#39;s all.  Look, I&#39;m just saying what everyone else already &#34;
 &#34;thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you&#39;re all sleepin&#39; in your &#34;
 &#34;room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They&#39;re gonna GETCHA! &#34;,
 &#39;-ed a fine time to leave me, LucilleFour hungry children and &#39;
 &#39;a-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;M GINGER!&#34;,
 &#39;Help me! Hellp mee!&#39;,
 &#34;And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn&#39;t born like this!&#34;,
 &#34;So I&#39;m gonna stay like this forever?&#34;,
 &#39;Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter &#39;
 &#39;what I look like!  Right, Mom?!  Mom?!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey dudes, what&#39;s goin&#39; on?  How is everything with you guys?&#34;,
 &#34;Yes, well, it&#39;s interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the &#34;
 &#39;doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment &#39;
 &#39;deficiency.&#39;,
 &#39;Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, Kyle.  The sun&#39;s rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected &#34;
 &#34;when I&#39;m outside. Well, I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve gotten all that out of the way, and &#34;
 &#39;now we can just go on with our lives as normal.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you mean, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34; Hm. I don&#39;t really see the irony in that, Kyle. &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s fine, get it out of the way...&#34;,
 &#39; Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m grubbin&#39;. What&#39;s it look like?&#34;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;But... it&#39;s me.&#34;,
 &#34;Guys! Okay, look, maybe I&#39;m ginger, but... I&#39;m not like other ginger kids. &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m still me inside. &#34;,
 &#34;I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I&#39;ve called this meeting &#34;
 &#34;because, I don&#39;t know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being &#34;
 &#39;discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and &#39;
 &#34;freckles, we&#39;re thought of as somehow less important, and it&#39;s bullcrap!&#34;,
 &#39;Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us &#34;genetically inferior.&#34; The &#39;
 &#39;world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love &#39;
 &#39;us for who we are!&#39;,
 &#34;...Riiight, exactly! We can&#39;t let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD &#34;
 &#39;of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. &#39;
 &#39;People like...  Like uh...  Liiike...&#39;,
 &#39;Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...&#39;,
 &#39;Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing &#39;
 &#39;things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are &#39;
 &#39;not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and &#39;
 &#34;super-smart. It&#39;s time for us to take back our pride!&#34;,
 &#39;Red Power! &#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans &#39;
 &#39;like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any &#39;
 &#39;longer, for we are a great race!&#39;,
 &#39; Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Red Power!&#39;,
 &#39;Better red than dead!&#39;,
 &#39;Better red than dead!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of &#34;
 &#39;Annie is being minimalized!&#39;,
 &#34;The bitch isn&#39;t ginger! She&#39;s just using makeup to look ginger! And &#34;
 &#39;pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!&#39;,
 &#39;There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!&#39;,
 &#34; Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feeln&#39;?  Can I get a Red Power?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn&#39;t it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! &#34;
 &#34;Now I don&#39;t think I need to tell you there&#39;s a lot of hate out there. Hate &#34;
 &#34;for awesome people like us. And if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned, is that &#34;
 &#39;the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of &#39;
 &#39;society, everyone else is!&#39;,
 &#39;Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of &#39;
 &#39;the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! &#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re fine, thanks.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re fine!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re welcome!! Now leave us alone!!  My fellow gingers! I envision a world &#34;
 &#39;in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must &#39;
 &#39;gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!&#39;,
 &#39;Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We &#39;
 &#39;will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown &#39;
 &#39;them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are &#39;
 &#39;you with me?!&#39;,
 &#39;My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! &#39;,
 &#39;What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every &#39;
 &#39;non-ginger child has been spilled! &#39;,
 &#34;No, we&#39;re fine! Thank you!&#34;,
 &#34;Yes! We&#39;re good!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We &#34;
 &#39;will start... with the daywalker!&#39;,
 &#39;Go on then! Say your last words!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you &#39;
 &#39;what? &#39;,
 &#39; Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized &#39;
 &#34;something.  We shouldn&#39;t be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we &#34;
 &#39;become?&#39;,
 &#34;D-don&#39;t you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn&#39;t ginger, then &#34;
 &#34;we&#39;re no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to &#34;
 &#39;learn to live... together.&#39;,
 &#34;Right, but... but I&#39;ve learned that we can&#39;t judge people based on what they &#34;
 &#39;look like.&#39;,
 &#34;See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we&#39;ve got to live and let live. &#34;,
 &#39;... Huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, &#39;
 &#39;totally unrelated.&#39;,
 &#39;No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school &#39;
 &#34;yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can&#39;t believe how great it &#34;
 &#34;feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn&#39;t this great you guys? We sure &#34;
 &#34;have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it&#39;s best to get &#34;
 &#34;along. Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we&#39;re all the &#34;
 &#34;same. Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn&#39;t kill each other, &#39;cause &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s lame. Come on, guys! Hand in hand, we can live together.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s it! You&#39;ve got it!&#34;,
 &#39;Live together!&#39;,
 &#39;The same, you and I!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, but I&#39;m not going to die.  That&#39;s why we gotta get along, people!&#34;,
 &#39;Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!&#39;,
 &#39;HA! Saving money, duhhh! &#39;,
 &#34;Hey, I know! Let&#39;s go play laser tag at FunPlex.&#34;,
 &#34;Stan, don&#39;t you know the first law of physics? Anything that&#39;s fun costs at &#34;
 &#39;least eight dollars.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, be a Jew. We&#39;re gonna go play laser tag. &#34;,
 &#39;Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m all wet! Sweet!&#34;,
 &#34;Haha! I&#39;m totally wet! This is awesome!!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes! Yeehehehes! &#39;,
 &#34;I think there&#39;s a sea lion show at 2:30.&#34;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn&#39;t gonna splash us any more, so who &#34;
 &#39;cares?&#39;,
 &#39;Killer. &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, Kyle. We&#39;re gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make &#34;
 &#34;love to the whale, that&#39;s fine. &#34;,
 &#39; Heh! Come on, stingray!  Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!  Dude, these things &#39;
 &#34;are dumb. Let&#39;s go!&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, guys, let&#39;s leave Kyle with his stupid whale.&#34;,
 &#39;You live on the moon?&#39;,
 &#39;Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.&#39;,
 &#34;He hasn&#39;t said a word since we brought him here.&#34;,
 &#39;Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.&#39;,
 &#39;We have to hurry!&#39;,
 &#39;Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh crap! There&#39;s more of them! &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. &#39;,
 &#39;Ichi banzai&#39;,
 &#39;Ichi banzai! Kya!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m doing some sweet banzai moves.  I&#39;m a little better than everyone else &#34;
 &#39;here.&#39;,
 &#34;Nah-uh, I don&#39;t raku disciprine!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, let&#39;s go.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, what the hell is he doing?&#39;,
 &#34;You know, Stan, I&#39;d say your dad racksa disciprine!&#34;,
 &#39;Man, that was such a bummer.&#39;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, Stan. Sure. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna miss him.  I&#39;m gonna miss Chef and I...and I don&#39;t know how to &#34;
 &#39;tell him! &#39;,
 &#39; Reverse to you, Jew. &#39;,
 &#39;All right! &#39;,
 &#39;Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh boy oh boy, I can&#39;t wait to have Chef&#39;s lunch food again.&#34;,
 &#39; Excuse me?&#39;,
 &#34;...Man, I can&#39;t believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman&#39;s boobs? Jewbs. &#34;,
 &#39;...Huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, son of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;No, Chef has always been super-cool.&#39;,
 &#39;So what can we do??&#39;,
 &#39;Come on, bitch! Dance!&#39;,
 &#34;Bitch, I&#39;ll twist your nuts off!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay Chef. Go on, remember!&#34;,
 &#34;Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that&#39;s totally fine. &#34;
 &#39;But why do you need Chef?!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!&#39;,
 &#39;Run Chef!&#39;,
 &#39;A mountain lion! &#39;,
 &#39;A grizzly bear!&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe- maybe he&#39;s still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do &#34;
 &#39;before you die is crap your-&#39;,
 &#39;Oh never mind.&#39;,
 &#34; Hey everybody! There&#39;s more pop in the refrigerator. Let&#39;s make this the &#34;
 &#39;best going-away party EVER! &#39;,
 &#39;Who? &#39;,
 &#39;Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally &#39;
 &#34;leaving! Come on, everyone! Let&#39;s sing!  Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! &#34;
 &#39;Goodbye Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, what are you doing?&#39;,
 &#34;THAT&#39;s gay, heh.&#34;,
 &#34;Why do you want Kyle back?? Don&#39;t you see how awesome it is without him?&#34;,
 &#34; Psh! Whatever dude. I don&#39;t need Kyle to rip on, I&#39;ve got Butters. Come on, &#34;
 &#39;Butters, you stupid Jew! &#39;,
 &#34;Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can&#39;t even play video football!&#34;,
 &#39;You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.&#39;,
 &#34;No, no! Don&#39;t apologize, you asshole!&#34;,
 &#39;Who?&#39;,
 &#39; The smug?&#39;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn &#34;
 &#34;Kyle&#39;s family to get out before the storm hits.&#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the &#34;
 &#39;hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and &#39;
 &#39;diehard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San &#39;
 &#34;Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I&#39;ll be tethered to you through &#34;
 &#34;this cord. It&#39;s my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop &#34;
 &#39;hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your &#39;
 &#39;strength.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not doin&#39; it for Kyle.  I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually going to walk &#34;
 &#39;through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. &#39;,
 &#39; Butters, are you there?!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve started to enter the smug. I&#39;m about a quarter mile in. Can you give me &#34;
 &#39;an EL?&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. It&#39;s just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.&#34;,
 &#39;Turning right at O two four niner. &#39;,
 &#34;Butters?! Butters, I think I&#39;m here! 2419 Castillo?!&#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! &#39;,
 &#34; Well, looks like you&#39;re back for good, huh Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;We just can&#39;t get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!&#34;,
 &#34;Ah, that&#39;s better. &#34;,
 &#39;You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?&#39;,
 &#39;Yich. &#39;,
 &#39;Yich.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh man, that&#39;s not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an &#34;
 &#34;entire group of people.  What, you guys think that&#39;s okay?! Do you care at &#34;
 &#34;all about people&#39;s feelings?!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s different! I&#39;m just a little boy! That&#39;s a cartoon! Millions of &#34;
 &#39;people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on &#39;
 &#39;television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m telling you guys, it&#39;s wrong! It&#39;s WRONG!!  It&#39;s wrong! &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family &#39;
 &#34;Guy, not because they can&#39;t jack off! Right, Wendy?&#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Goddamned Family Guy! Now they&#39;re just provoking people! It&#39;s like they want &#34;
 &#39;a holy war!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!&#39;,
 &#39;We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get &#39;
 &#39;that episode pulled. You guys with me?&#39;,
 &#34;Then we&#39;ll ride our Big Wheels.&#34;,
 &#34;If that&#39;s what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy &#34;
 &#34;writers aren&#39;t gonna back down!&#34;,
 &#39;Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get &#39;
 &#39;hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little &#39;
 &#34;joke, will you still think it&#39;s funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will &#34;
 &#34;it be funny then, Kyle?  I&#39;m going to Los Angeles. I&#39;m gonna do whatever I &#34;
 &#39;can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to &#39;
 &#34;speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what&#39;s right. &#34;,
 &#34;Come to try and stop me?!  It isn&#39;t gonna work. &#34;,
 &#34; Yeah well, I don&#39;t need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;trust me. &#39;,
 &#34; Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I&#39;ve been doing the wrong things for a long &#34;
 &#39;time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something &#39;
 &#39;right, you know? Just this one time.&#39;,
 &#39;You know we might not even make it into the studio.&#39;,
 &#39;So what made you change your mind?&#39;,
 &#34;Well Kyle, we&#39;d better get going.&#34;,
 &#39;Are you set?&#39;,
 &#34;All right, let&#39;s roll! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air &#39;
 &#39;forever.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever &#34;
 &#39;is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode &#39;
 &#34;for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show &#39;
 &#34;get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It&#39;s exactly &#34;
 &#39;what happened to Laverne &amp; Shirley.&#39;,
 &#34;Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that&#39;s wrong.&#34;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! &#34;
 &#39;Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you &#39;
 &#39;stand! &#39;,
 &#39;Do you have any idea what it\&#39;s like?! Everywhere I go, &#34;Hey Cartman, you &#39;
 &#39;must like Family Guy, right?&#34; &#34;Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family &#39;
 &#39;Guy, Cartman.&#34;  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are &#39;
 &#39;inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is &#39;
 &#39;relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!&#39;,
 &#34;YOU DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND!&#34;,
 &#34;Well... I guess you won&#39;t be helping me now. No biggie. I don&#39;t NEED you to &#34;
 &#39;get the episode pulled! &#39;,
 &#39;Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, stop it!&#39;,
 &#39;Holy Crap! &#39;,
 &#39;Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; Suck mah balls, Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39; This... explains everything.&#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, quit it! Quit it, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets &#34;
 &#39;out of hand.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, stop it!&#39;,
 &#39;So long, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;Ma&#39;am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammed episode be pulled &#34;
 &#34;before it airs tonight! It&#39;s incendiary, it&#39;s offensive to Muslims, and &#34;
 &#34;people can get hurt! It&#39;s wrong! It&#39;s WROOONG!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, can I go before you?&#39;,
 &#34;So... you don&#39;t like Family Guy either, huh?&#34;,
 &#34;So what&#39;s your plan? You&#39;re gonna ask the president of the network nicely to &#34;
 &#39;take it off the air?&#39;,
 &#39;Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode &#39;
 &#39;pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammed thing as a way to scare the &#39;
 &#34;network into pulling tonight&#39;s show. I&#39;m going to use fear to get them to do &#34;
 &#39;what I want.&#39;,
 &#34;...No, it isn&#39;t like terrorism. It IS terrorism.&#34;,
 &#39;This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.&#39;,
 &#34;Really? What&#39;s the worst thing you&#39;ve ever done?&#34;,
 &#34;Wow, that&#39;s pretty hardcore. Geez. That&#39;s like this one time, when I didn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.&#39;,
 &#39;Seeya.&#39;,
 &#34; Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won&#39;t take &#34;
 &#34;much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it&#39;s the only way I can get &#34;
 &#39;around these days. Ow...&#39;,
 &#39;You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. &#39;
 &#39;His newspaper showed an image of Mohammed and, two days later, terrorists &#39;
 &#39;suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First &#39;
 &#39;one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept &#39;
 &#39;coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after &#39;
 &#34;another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don&#39;t wanna see people &#34;
 &#39;here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your &#39;
 &#39;responsibility.  Ow..&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll certainly do my best.  Ow.&#34;,
 &#39; Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.&#39;,
 &#39; I I said &#34;thank you.&#34; Thank you for listening. &#39;,
 &#34;It won&#39;t take long, sir.  Ow...&#34;,
 &#34; Yes, I&#39;m totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.&#34;,
 &#39; Wha?  What are they?&#39;,
 &#39;Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.&#39;,
 &#39;Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammed be &#39;
 &#34;shown? How? Manatees don&#39;t talk!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network &#39;
 &#34;to pull your episode with Mohammed. See, I&#39;m the victim of a, a terrorist &#34;
 &#39;attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-&#39;,
 &#39;Why not?&#39;,
 &#39; Son of a bitch.&#39;,
 &#39; Well well well! &#39;,
 &#34;Hello, Kyle. Looks like you&#39;ve run into a little snag in your plan as well.&#34;,
 &#34;You came so close to stopping me, didn&#39;t you, Kyle. There was just one thing &#34;
 &#34;you didn&#39;t count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.&#34;,
 &#34;Not yet! But I&#39;ve come up with a new plan. I&#39;ve learned how to make the &#34;
 &#39;Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their &#39;
 &#39;lunch break, I can sneak back in.&#39;,
 &#34;Good, Kyle! That&#39;s good anger you&#39;re showin&#39; there! See that?! That&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;emotional character development based on what&#39;s happening in the storyline! &#34;
 &#34;Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, Kyle,  I&#39;ve got some &#34;
 &#39;idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.&#39;,
 &#34; Sir! Sir!  If you don&#39;t my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in &#34;
 &#39;to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to &#39;
 &#39;work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now &#39;
 &#39;they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this &#39;
 &#34;network, not them. Maybe it&#39;s time you showed them who&#39;s in charge.&#34;,
 &#39;I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!&#39;,
 &#39;Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!&#39;,
 &#39;How the hell did you get out?&#39;,
 &#34;Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn&#39;t you?!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! &#34;
 &#39;Family Guy is as good as dead!&#39;,
 &#34; I can&#39;t let you do that!&#34;,
 &#39; Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. &#39;
 &#34;OW! Stop it! Kyle, that&#39;s too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!&#34;,
 &#39;Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Stop it!&#39;,
 &#39;Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, &#39;
 &#39;time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. &#39;
 &#39;Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!&#39;,
 &#39;Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the &#39;
 &#39;balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No &#39;
 &#39;hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... &#39;
 &#39;Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers &#39;
 &#39;crossed. &#39;,
 &#39;Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!&#39;,
 &#39;No! Think about the people who could get hurt!&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammed episode, now!&#34;,
 &#39;Shut up, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!&#39;,
 &#39;No gay speeches, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;No! No, I hate Family Guy!! &#39;,
 &#34; Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can&#39;t block like that.&#34;,
 &#34;Hang on. I&#39;m going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#34; All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I&#39;m about to do. &#34;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! &#34;,
 &#39;Dude, what are you doing?&#39;,
 &#34;No, dude, he&#39;s half man and half bear and half pig.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?&#39;,
 &#34;Ah I don&#39;t think so, dude. &#34;,
 &#39;You... have that kind of power?&#39;,
 &#39;Somebody get us some help down hyah!&#39;,
 &#39;Hello??&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;d better get us out of here, asshole!&#34;,
 &#34;You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we&#39;re trapped in a cave!&#34;,
 &#34; This is... bullcrap! If I&#39;ma thin I&#39;m gonna be so... pissed off!  &#34;
 &#39;Goddamnit! &#39;,
 &#39; No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! &#34;,
 &#34;You guys go on ahead. I&#39;m gonna... stay here, wait it out. &#34;,
 &#34;I just... I I don&#39;t feel very good. I&#39;ll just wa-, I&#39;ll just weigh you guys &#34;
 &#39;down.&#39;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s okay. You guys go on ahead.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s cool. I just... I just wouldn&#39;t go over there  if I were you guys. I &#34;
 &#39;just took a huge dump.&#39;,
 &#39;I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.&#39;,
 &#34; All that treasure.  It&#39;s all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my &#39;
 &#34;treasure, wouldn&#39;t you?! Even though I found it, you&#39;d love to think it&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you &#39;
 &#34;money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;never going to get my treasure. I&#39;ve got a little plan going, to get the &#34;
 &#39;treasure out of here without you ever knowing. &#39;,
 &#34; Oh. Hey Kyle. How&#39;s it goin&#39;?&#34;,
 &#34;Not much. You know, just hangin&#39; out. How&#39;ve you been, man? Good?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah. It&#39;s nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. &#34;,
 &#34; All right. Gotta be strong.  There&#39;s still a lot more treasure to go. &#34;,
 &#39;Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.&#39;,

 &#39;Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. &#39;,
 &#34;You guys, we&#39;ve got no time! You gotta get me out!! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes you do! &#39;,
 &#39;No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;Grab my hand.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t kick!&#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t! Kick yourself back to safety!&#34;,
 &#39;No, you just have to save me. &#39;,
 &#34;No! No I&#39;m fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.&#34;,
 &#39; Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... &#39;
 &#39;HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s mine! It&#39;s mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to &#34;
 &#39;me! Keep your greedy hands away!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, and I...  Fake treasure?&#34;,
 &#39;Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you think I&#39;m hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!&#34;,
 &#39;Eh! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner&#39;s ankle to the school flagpole.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;m sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner&#39;s ankle to a flagpole and then &#34;
 &#39;gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that &#39;
 &#39;the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through &#39;
 &#39;his leg.&#39;,
 &#39;Well he called me chubby!&#39;,
 &#34;Well nice goin&#39;, asshole! You made my mom cry!&#34;,
 &#34;Sure you do. You&#39;re a great mom. Who&#39;s got the greatest mom in the world? I &#34;
 &#34;dooo. My mom is number one in my heart. It&#39;s true!&#34;,
 &#39; Mom, I need another energy drink! &#39;,
 &#39; Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! &#39;,
 &#34;Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody&#39;s at the door!&#34;,
 &#34;Killer. I&#39;m gonna be on TV now. &#34;,
 &#39;Mom, I want a Twinkie.&#39;,
 &#39; Ha! Hahahahahaha&#39;,
 &#34;No thanks, I&#39;d rahther naught.&#34;,
 &#34;The hell do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;,
 &#39;Stop trying to bogart my X-Box, you fat bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;Time out?&#39;,
 &#39; And what exactly keeps me on the stool?&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa, how did I do that? &#39;,
 &#39;Ummm, no?&#39;,
 &#34;All right, seriously, you&#39;re starting to piss me off now.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just gonna get down as soon as you move.&#34;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.&#34;,
 &#39;Because you took my X-Box.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. I guess so.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m feeling confused, because I don&#39;t understand why you became a &#34;
 &#39;nanny.&#39;,
 &#34;Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you&#39;re not a mommy?&#34;,
 &#39;Why not?&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re sterile, is that it?  No, that&#39;s too convenient of an excuse. The &#34;
 &#34;truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn&#39;t that it?  Always &#34;
 &#34;the mom&#39;s maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the &#34;
 &#39;years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while &#39;
 &#39;your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally &#39;
 &#39;worthless.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won&#39;t make &#34;
 &#39;your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! &#39;,
 &#34;You can stop talkin&#39; behind my back; I&#39;m right here, fruitcake.&#34;,
 &#39;Not interested im me?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, well I don&#39;t see why-&#34;,
 &#39;Hey!&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, this guy doesn&#39;t-&#34;,
 &#39;Ah! Quit it!&#39;,
 &#39;Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-&#39;,
 &#39;KNOCK IT OFF!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not fat!&#34;,
 &#39;Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, this is degrading!&#39;,
 &#39;Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! &#39;,
 &#39;Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, don&#39;t you love me? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m unhappy right now?&#34;,
 &#39;Mom!&#39;,
 &#39; God damnit stop ignoring me!&#39;,
 &#39;This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!&#39;,
 &#39;Quit it, mom!&#39;,
 &#39;Ooo, Colonel?&#39;,
 &#39;Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.&#39;,
 &#39;Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!&#39;,
 &#39; Goddamnit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the &#39;
 &#39;chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the &#39;
 &#39;chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!&#39;,
 &#34;Gih-  Okay, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m cool now. May I have some chicken please?&#34;,
 &#39;Suck my asshole, taco vendor!&#39;,
 &#34;Goddamnit, you can&#39;t stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it &#34;
 &#39;over!&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t do that to me, I-&#34;,
 &#34;Goddamnit, you just can&#39;t-&#34;,
 &#39;Seriously! Ey? Eh... &#39;,
 &#39; Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here &#39;
 &#34;and give me a piece of chicken!  That&#39;s how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I &#34;
 &#34;hate you! I&#39;m running away!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey guys, I&#39;ve got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom &#34;
 &#34;just... doesn&#39;t care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn&#39;t even try &#34;
 &#34;to stop me. It&#39;s gonna be tough livin&#39; on my own. But I&#39;ll get by, somehow.&#34;,
 &#34;Maybe you didn&#39;t hear me! I ran away! I don&#39;t have anywhere to sleep! I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;out on the street!&#39;,
 &#34;All right, that&#39;s fine! Butters, I&#39;ll crash with you.&#34;,
 &#34;Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny&#39;s house?!  His &#34;
 &#34;family&#39;s totally poor; I&#39;m not staying with poor people!  All right, I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#34;stay with Kenny. Let&#39;s go, man.&#34;,
 &#39;Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the &#39;
 &#34;chips are down you won&#39;t even lend a hand! I&#39;ll just go sleep on the street &#34;
 &#39;somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some &#39;
 &#34;minorities! You guys&#39;ll be sorry when I turn up dead! &#34;,
 &#34;Hey Jimmy. You&#39;re not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I &#34;
 &#39;just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.&#39;,
 &#34;You are, Jimmy! We&#39;ve always been best friends. We know everything about &#34;
 &#39;each other.&#39;,
 &#34; Goddamnit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You&#39;re the first person I &#34;
 &#34;came to. I knew you&#39;d take me in off the streets.&#34;,
 &#39;...Should that really matter at a time like this?&#39;,
 &#34;This is bullcrap! Mom&#39;ll break soon. I can outlast her.&#34;,
 &#34;All right, I&#39;m back.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes, well, hopefully you&#39;ve learned your lesson! I&#39;ve come back, but there&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;going to be some changes around here.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s super-interesting. But I&#39;ve been out living in the streets for almost &#34;
 &#39;four hours! Make me something to eat.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw, Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#39;What is he still doing here?!&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This &#39;
 &#39;is just like Auschwitz!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That&#39;s it. I&#39;m calling child-protective &#34;
 &#39;services! &#39;,
 &#34;Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he&#39;s not gone, in two &#34;
 &#39;minutes, I will call social services on you!&#39;,
 &#39;I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-&#39;,
 &#34;Mon, know it off! I&#39;m not gonna stand for th-&#34;,
 &#39;Seriously! Mom-&#39;,
 &#39;Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?&#39;,
 &#39;Mom?!&#39;,
 &#39;Mom? Mom...&#39;,
 &#34;Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;happening to me?&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I&#39;ve thought about it a &#34;
 &#34;lot and I&#39;ve decided I have to kill my mom.&#34;,
 &#34;She doesn&#39;t let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten &#34;
 &#39;out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her &#39;
 &#34;trying to run my life. She&#39;s like Hitler with all the demands she makes.&#34;,
 &#34;Yes! I&#39;ve lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know &#34;
 &#34;how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It&#39;s my &#34;
 &#39;only way out.&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All &#34;
 &#34;right now, here&#39;s the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and &#34;
 &#39;leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the &#39;
 &#39;house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to &#39;
 &#39;Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs &#39;
 &#39;to kill my mom.&#39;,
 &#34;Well I can&#39;t kill her. I&#39;m too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her &#34;
 &#39;room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle &#39;
 &#34;puts a pillow over my mom&#39;s head, and Stan shoots her in the face.&#34;,
 &#34;Well I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything &#34;
 &#39;here?!&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom&#39;s head with a pillow and Kyle can &#34;
 &#39;shoot her in the face.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I&#39;ll just do &#34;
 &#34;everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I&#39;ll do it &#34;
 &#39;by myself!&#39;,
 &#34;You forced me to do this! You couldn&#39;t just love me as a son.  You just had &#34;
 &#34;to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won&#39;t let you dominate my &#34;
 &#39;life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. &#39;,
 &#34; No! She&#39;s my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It&#39;s more important &#34;
 &#39;that I live the way I want!&#39;,
 &#34;She isn&#39;t an object I can own. Sh-she&#39;s a human being.&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...&#39;,
 &#34; Maybe the world doesn&#39;t revolve around me. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah Mom, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s grapefruit and lean han.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.&#39;,
 &#39;Tha... thank you?&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;K Mom, you&#39;re embarrassing me, jeez. &#34;,
 &#34;I cleared up the table, Mom. I&#39;m gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. &#34;,
 &#34;No, that&#39;s okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science &#34;
 &#39;project then.&#39;,
 &#39;Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;m back.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m sorry, I had to take a dump!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, I don&#39;t need to take any lip from a frickin&#39; girl!&#34;,
 &#39;Heheh, totally, heheh.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, come on, let&#39;s go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s bullcrap. I&#39;ll bet half these of these people are Koreans.&#34;,
 &#39;Get out of here, asshole!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! &#34;,
 &#39;That sonofabitch!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s a Goddamned butthole!&#34;,
 &#39;My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft &#39;
 &#39;and killing all our characters.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve learned that the four of us can&#39;t fight him alone. But, if we all log &#34;
 &#39;in together!, we might have a chance.&#39;,
 &#39;Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop &#39;
 &#34;Hitler, wouldn&#39;t you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn&#39;t stop him because &#34;
 &#39;I think he was awesome, but you would, right?&#39;,
 &#39;When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped &#39;
 &#39;playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?&#39;,
 &#39;Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will &#39;
 &#39;meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to &#39;
 &#39;victory!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the &#39;
 &#39;online sensation before we all murder you.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click &#39;
 &#39;on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect &#39;
 &#39;buff.&#39;,
 &#39;The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special &#39;
 &#39;abilities macroed to your keyboards.&#39;,
 &#39;This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of &#39;
 &#39;Azeroth!  From with-&#39;,
 &#39;Butters? What the hell are you doing?&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t be the dwarf character, Butters, I&#39;m the dwarf.&#34;,
 &#34;So pick another one! I&#39;m the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a &#34;
 &#39;new character, and log back in!&#39;,
 &#34; Then let&#39;s move out! &#34;,
 &#39;Everyone hold! &#39;,
 &#39;Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And... &#39;
 &#39;Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! &#39;,
 &#39;All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? &#39;
 &#39;Clyde!  Clyde! Come on, you guys, move!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!&#39;,
 &#34;Now, leave me alone, don&#39;t do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit! &#34;,
 &#34;What the hell are you guys doing?? Don&#39;t tell me you all quit playing World &#34;
 &#39;of Warcraft too?!&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, when things look bad, you can&#39;t just give up on the world. Of &#34;
 &#39;Warcraft.&#39;,
 &#34;I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one &#34;
 &#39;blow.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and &#39;
 &#39;eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and &#39;
 &#39;twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you &#39;
 &#39;say, guys? You can just, you can just hang outside in the sun all day &#39;
 &#34;tossin&#39; a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin&#39; &#34;
 &#39;that matters.&#39;,
 &#39;Come on, Kyle! You can do it!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final &#39;
 &#39;battle. Everyone, log in!&#39;,
 &#34; Everyonen equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven&#39;t already. Uh, &#34;
 &#39;Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.&#39;,
 &#39;Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?&#39;,
 &#39;Give the cloak to Kenny: he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I have that covered.  Mom?&#34;,
 &#39;More Hot Pockets!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, everyone ready?&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go get him! &#34;,
 &#39;Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.&#39;,
 &#39;Command-0...&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use &#39;
 &#39;intimidating shout. Okay, he sees us.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Aren&#39;t you spec&#39;d to reduce cast time?&#34;,
 &#39;...Christ.&#39;,
 &#39;Everyone target scorpions.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle! Fire spell!&#39;,
 &#39;Wait, we need Ben-Gay. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going as fast as I can!&#34;,
 &#34;All right, major stone shield potions should be... Oh God, I&#39;m going to have &#34;
 &#39;diarrhea again. Ohhh-... Duuuh-...&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay.  Mom? Bathroom!&#34;,
 &#39;Bathroom! Bathroom! &#39;,
 &#34;All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I&#39;m now going to use &#34;
 &#39;mocking blow.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, cast arcane missile!&#39;,
 &#39;Stan, what the hell are you doing?! &#39;,
 &#39;His shield and armor spells are down!&#39;,
 &#34;Looks like you&#39;re about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, yay.&#39;,
 &#34;We did it you guys. We&#39;re totally heroes.&#34;,
 &#39;What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury &#39;
 &#39;talents to boost your shots.&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of &#39;
 &#39;conspiracy, just like 9/11.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you&#39;re told, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;They aren&#39;t going to find out who did it. But they&#39;ll make up a scapegoat, &#34;
 &#34;send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It&#39;ll be 9/11 all over &#34;
 &#39;again.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think &#39;
 &#39;that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are &#39;
 &#39;retards?&#39;,
 &#39;...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! &#39;,
 &#39;Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do &#39;
 &#39;you think there was some kind of coverup?&#39;,
 &#39;Aha! Do you see?&#39;,
 &#39;I rest my case.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;What?! People see the truth?!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys are blind!! I can&#39;t believe that everyone here is just buying into &#34;
 &#34;what they&#39;re told by the media!  I&#39;m gonna go find out the truth. I&#39;m gonna &#34;
 &#39;blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! &#39;,
 &#39;It is wrong for me to ask questions? Is it wrong to seek the truth? I just &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t blindly accept their version. I can&#39;t base my logic on proof. Almost &#34;
 &#34;all the evidence points one way, But I&#39;m like Charlie Sheen and Gloria &#34;
 &#39;Estefan: I need to know what really happened On &#39;
 &#34;9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven. What really happened On 9/11? Of course. It&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;so obvious. How did we not see it before?&#39;,
 &#39; Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!&#39;,
 &#39; For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report &#39;
 &#39;on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! &#39;,
 &#39; We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel &#39;
 &#39;framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet &#39;
 &#34;fuel doesn&#39;t burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told &#34;
 &#39;the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this &#39;
 &#39;photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit &#39;
 &#39;it, where is the rest of the plane?&#39;,
 &#34;So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn&#39;t cause 9/11, who did?  &#34;
 &#39;Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - &#39;
 &#39;11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on &#39;
 &#34;Silverstein&#39;s board of directors. That&#39;s nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take &#34;
 &#39;2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the &#39;
 &#39;9/11 attacks. .Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday &#39;
 &#39;where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with &#39;
 &#34;911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it&#39;s 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on &#34;
 &#39;his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from &#39;
 &#39;9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! &#39;
 &#39;Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of &#39;
 &#39;all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw &#39;
 &#39;what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You &#39;
 &#39;almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.&#39;,
 &#39;And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly &#39;
 &#39;Nelson, and I said, &#34;Do you smell lemon grrass?&#34;, and she smelled my finger &#39;
 &#39;and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.&#39;,
 &#34;What? I didn&#39;t do it, Kelly Nelson&#39;s a liar!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the &#39;
 &#39;fuck do you think you are?!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you&#39;re a hallway monitor?! Because &#34;
 &#34;you don&#39;t have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill &#34;
 &#39;yourself!!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn&#39;t mean to do it, how could I have &#34;
 &#39;been so foolish?&#39;,
 &#39;The hall monit- me?&#39;,
 &#39; Auth- authoritih?&#39;,
 &#39;Ahem. Me?&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s fear and darkness all around you The criminals are on the run No use &#34;
 &#34;in not having your hall pass I&#39;ll take you to the principal &#39;cause I&#39;m the &#34;
 &#39;Dawg I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg The Hallway Monitor! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s cool. I&#39;m done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall &#34;
 &#39;pass!&#39;,
 &#39; You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now &#39;
 &#39;let me see your hall pass!&#39;,
 &#39; All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. &#39;,
 &#39; Argh!&#39;,
 &#39; I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!&#39;,
 &#39; Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!&#39;,
 &#39;I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on &#39;
 &#39;you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go &#39;
 &#39;with Christ. Here you go. &#39;,
 &#34;Hey! I don&#39;t tell you how to run your class, don&#39;t tell me how to run my &#34;
 &#39;hallway! &#39;,
 &#39; Hands?! Let me see those hands!&#39;,
 &#34; Where&#39;s your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!&#34;,
 &#39;I knew it! &#39;,
 &#34;Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don&#39;t have any hard feelin&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;against you all right?&#39;,
 &#39;Here, you need a smoke, brah?&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.&#34;,
 &#39;Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the &#39;
 &#39;hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. &#39;,
 &#34;Brahs, it&#39;s almost class time. I need you to start clearin&#39; the hallways &#34;
 &#39;aright?&#39;,
 &#34;Damn, brah, your little brother&#39;s pretty cool.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then &#34;
 &#39;stick it inside her and pee.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, okay, fine. Unless you don&#39;t want to get her pregnant, then you pull &#34;
 &#39;it out and pee on her leg.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve got bigger things to deal with.&#34;,
 &#39;They what??&#39;,
 &#39; Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school &#39;
 &#39;policy!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, well now it&#39;s personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there&#39;s a &#34;
 &#34;hallway infraction going on, they&#39;re gonna have to deal with the Dawg!&#34;,
 &#39;Hall infraction! &#39;,
 &#39;You got a hall pass, brah?!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah? Well, where&#39;s his hall pass?!&#34;,
 &#39;Get down on the floor!&#39;,
 &#39; You like bear mace, icehead?!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re goin&#39; with Christ! &#34;,
 &#34;...And that&#39;s what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway &#34;
 &#39;making out. She had those love letters on her person.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.&#39;,
 &#34;I know. It&#39;s like a hall pass doesn&#39;t even matter to her.&#34;,
 &#39;You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!&#39;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh no!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t believe it. She&#39;s using the Mel Gibson defense.&#34;,
 &#39;There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!&#39;,
 &#34;No, they haven&#39;t left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.&#34;,
 &#39;I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.&#39;,
 &#34;Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I&#39;m gonna get that &#34;
 &#39;hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!&#39;,
 &#39;I got some badass guys to help me. I only had to pay them fifteen bucks. You &#39;
 &#34;think you got away with not having a hall pass? You won&#39;t get away from me &#34;
 &#34;&#39;cause I&#39;m the Dawg! I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg! Think you can get away &#34;
 &#39;with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?&#39;,
 &#34;Yep. We&#39;re all done with the video, let&#39;s move out! &#34;,
 &#39;Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and &#39;
 &#39;clean!&#39;,
 &#39; Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search &#39;
 &#34;it. Here&#39;s the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;go! Move out! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;m a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our &#34;
 &#39;twenty!&#39;,
 &#34;You seen this woman, brah?  She&#39;s staying here!&#34;,
 &#39;I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!&#39;,
 &#34;Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let&#39;s check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go &#34;
 &#39;that way! Beth, you come with me!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!&#34;,
 &#39; Keep your mouth shut, brah!!&#39;,
 &#34;Praise Christ! Let&#39;s go! &#34;,
 &#39;Bear mace that guy! And that guy! &#39;,
 &#39;Freeze, bitch!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all right! There&#39;s been a misunderstanding! I&#39;m a hall monitor.  This &#34;
 &#39;fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.&#39;,
 &#39;Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!&#39;,
 &#34; Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you&#39;ve learned, &#34;
 &#34;kids, that if you don&#39;t go with Christ, you could end up just like that &#34;
 &#39;splattered bitch down on the pavement.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s cool. I&#39;m done making my video anyways. &#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name &#34;
 &#39;three times.&#39;,
 &#34;See? You&#39;re scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he&#39;s gonna &#34;
 &#39;show up and shoot you in the face. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve done it lots of times.&#34;,
 &#34; Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let&#39;s do &#34;
 &#34;somethin&#39; else.&#34;,
 &#39;I am not!&#39;,
 &#39; Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... &#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You &#39;
 &#39;guys! You guys, check it out!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude...&#39;,
 &#34;You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin&#39; on booze at the House of &#34;
 &#39;Blues&#39;,
 &#39;How do you know??&#39;,
 &#34;How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn&#39;t with Biggie right now? &#34;
 &#39;Being tormented by him?&#39;,
 &#39; Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.&#34;,
 &#39;Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!&#39;,
 &#34; No Mom, you don&#39;t understand! I&#39;ve been waiting for this thing to come out &#34;
 &#34;for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It&#39;s like... waiting &#34;
 &#39;for Christmas... times a thousand.&#39;,
 &#39;Noo!! Nooo!!&#39;,
 &#39;How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh God...  Okay, how long now?&#39;,
 &#34; HEHHH! I can&#39;t take it anymore! HAAAAAH!&#34;,
 &#39;Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! &#39;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh God!&#39;,
 &#39;Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally &#34;
 &#39;killing me.&#39;,
 &#39; No. There is something I can do.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in &#39;
 &#39;suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I &#39;
 &#39;figured out how to do it.&#39;,
 &#39;Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii &#39;
 &#39;comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s simple science, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don&#39;t you see this is my only &#34;
 &#39;chance!!&#39;,
 &#34;I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everthing we&#39;ve &#34;
 &#34;been through together, you guys won&#39;t even help me freeze myself! &#34;,
 &#39; Ey!&#39;,
 &#34;Close the door, I&#39;m trying to freeze!&#34;,
 &#34; No! No, it&#39;s too soon!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gonna help me freeze myself.&#34;,
 &#34; Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they&#39;ll try to unfreeze &#34;
 &#34;me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That&#39;s good.  And no matter what &#34;
 &#39;happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii &#39;
 &#39;comes out. Do you got it?!&#39;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s not a good idea. It&#39;s an awesome idea&#34;,
 &#34;All right, you got the spot figured out? You&#39;re not gonna lose where I am, &#34;
 &#39;right?&#39;,
 &#34;All right, now get out of here. You can&#39;t freeze too, or else we&#39;re both &#34;
 &#34;screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You&#39;re gonna ruin everything!&#34;,
 &#39; Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.&#39;,
 &#34;Nin-ten-do. I&#39;m coming. I&#39;m coming, Nin-ten-do.&#34;,
 &#39;Where am I?&#39;,
 &#39;Safe where, butthole?!&#39;,
 &#39; What??&#39;,
 &#34;Is the Wii out? Where&#39;s the Wii?&#34;,
 &#39;Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!&#34;,
 &#39;No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!&#39;,
 &#39;This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. &#39;,
 &#39;What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!&#39;,
 &#34;So I&#39;m not too late! Come on, let&#39;s go!&#34;,
 &#34;I know I&#39;m special. This isn&#39;t news to me.&#34;,
 &#39; And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?&#39;,
 &#39;Who? &#39;,
 &#39;Who are they??&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.&#34;,
 &#39;What??&#39;,
 &#34;Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;need lectures.&#39;,
 &#34; We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin&#39; to &#34;
 &#39;worry abuot. &#39;,
 &#39;Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.&#39;,
 &#34;Over here!  Yeah it&#39;s here! It&#39;s here! The Nintendo Wii... I&#39;ve waited so &#34;
 &#39;long for this. &#39;,
 &#34;Sorry Blavius. I&#39;ve got other plans. &#34;,
 &#39;I got it! I got the Wii!&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: &#39;
 &#34;next time I&#39;m in a recessed biocave, don&#39;t send me a level 2 homing call. &#34;,
 &#34; Oh I can&#39;t wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!&#34;,
 &#39;Here. &#39;,
 &#39; Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to &#39;
 &#39;my float screen NOW! &#39;,
 &#39;Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taling so long! I wanna play!&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s gotta be some way to hook it up! It&#39;s the freakin&#39; future!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve gotta be shittin&#39; me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the &#34;
 &#39;future! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s wrong! I&#39;ve been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo &#34;
 &#34;Wii! And if I don&#39;t get to play real soon, I&#39;m gonna bust a nut!&#34;,
 &#34;Suck my balls, K-10. I&#39;m not in the mood.&#34;,
 &#34;God I hate future TV. There&#39;s too many commercials! &#34;,
 &#39;Tell me about it.&#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Why didn&#39;t anyone tell me there was a time phone?!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past &#34;
 &#39;and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and &#39;
 &#39;play Nintendo Wii.&#39;,
 &#34;I care! Where&#39;s the closest toy store??&#34;,
 &#39;Come on! Come on!&#39;,
 &#39;Ugh, finally!&#39;,
 &#39;I want one of those time-phone things.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah, I&#39;m only gonna prank-call people.&#34;,
 &#39;Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!&#39;,
 &#39;Look, I have to have one of those phones!&#39;,
 &#39;How about a robot? How much for the robot?&#39;,
 &#34; Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store&#39;s sales records?&#34;,
 &#34;I want the name and address of anybody who&#39;s bought a time phone from this &#34;
 &#39;guy in the past week.&#39;,
 &#34;Hello, I&#39;m with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram &#34;
 &#39;for inhibitors.&#39;,
 &#39; Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... &#39;,
 &#39; Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh God!  Hello? &#39;,
 &#39;Who is this?&#39;,
 &#39;What?? Who the hell is this?!&#39;,
 &#39;Me who?!&#39;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh very funny, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.&#39;,
 &#39;Listen to this!  Dickhead. &#39;,
 &#39;Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, Butters, it&#39;s gonna get dark!&#34;,
 &#39;What??  Who the fuck is this?!&#39;,
 &#39;Suck my balls!&#39;,
 &#39;...Okay, you have one minute.&#39;,
 &#39; Are you spying on me?!&#39;,
 &#34;Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we&#39;re going!&#34;,
 &#34;This is terrible! I&#39;m gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo &#34;
 &#39;Wii?!&#39;,
 &#39;What is the Great Question?&#39;,
 &#39;I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they &#39;
 &#34;think I&#39;m crank-calling them?!&#34;,
 &#39;Who?&#39;,
 &#34;Garrison? But he&#39;s an asshole.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s an emergency! It&#39;s an emergency!&#34;,
 &#39;I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!&#39;,
 &#39;Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever &#39;
 &#39;Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! &#39;,
 &#39; Go... Right... Where am I going? &#39;,
 &#34;Wait... Isn&#39;t... everybody at war over atheism?&#34;,
 &#39;So there is no war now in the future.&#39;,
 &#39; And what was that purpose again?&#39;,
 &#39;Right... &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll miss you too, COCKA-3.&#34;,
 &#34;Noooo!  I&#39;m back. Wow! I&#39;m back!&#34;,
 &#39;Mom! Mom, they did it!&#39;,
 &#34; No, I know. You&#39;re right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can &#34;
 &#39;wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.&#39;,
 &#39;What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t wait two months!  I can&#39;t! There has to be a way around this!&#34;,
 &#39;Hello?&#39;,
 &#39;...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, that was the funniest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I watched it on YouTube &#34;
 &#39;about sixty times.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah well, it&#39;s not us you have to worry about. It&#39;s Token. {points at the &#34;
 &#34;camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Token, who&#39;s putting &#34;
 &#39;some books into his locker] He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.&#39;,
 &#39;Ohhhhhhhh?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh shit here we go!  It&#39;s on! RACE WAR!!!  RACE WAR! RACE WAR!  Race war is &#34;
 &#34;on, everybody! It&#39;s going down! Shit is going down! &#34;,
 &#39; Yeah, come on! Here we go!&#39;,
 &#39; Race war! Come on! Race war!&#39;,
 &#39;Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! &#39;
 &#39;Whites won again!&#39;,
 &#39;No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! &#39;,
 &#39; Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...&#39;,
 &#39;Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. &#39;,
 &#39; Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? &#39;,
 &#39; Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all &#39;
 &#34;up like little beavers, right, and then put &#39;em in a pond, and see if they &#34;
 &#39;build a dam! &#39;,
 &#39; Barely! &#39;,
 &#39; &#34;Rise above it!&#34; Get it? Like he can rise above anything! &#39;,
 &#34;Look, look how his face gets all red! He&#39;s like a little strawberry!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that&#39;s fuckin&#39; funny?!  Kyle, did you &#34;
 &#39;put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!&#39;,
 &#39;Alrightalrightalright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in &#39;
 &#39;little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a midget, dude.&#34;,
 &#34;Hahaha, no dude. It can&#39;t talk, that isn&#39;t fair, I&#39;ll laugh too much. &#34;,
 &#39;Say &#34;Uncle!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Hahaha, now say &#34;Caroline, don\&#39;t go into the light!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!&#39;,
 &#39;This picture I like to call &#34;The Pierre.&#34; I invited Butters to stay the &#39;
 &#39;night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. &#39;
 &#39;Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in &#39;
 &#39;his mouth.  I call this picture &#34;The Sleeping Menstrual&#34;  This one, I call &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Hot Fudge Mondae.&#34;  I really like how the light plays with the background &#39;
 &#39;on this one.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh no, there&#39;s much more.  Let&#39;s see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it &#34;
 &#39;&#34;New Moon Rising.&#34;  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some &#39;
 &#39;high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But &#39;
 &#39;this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going &#39;
 &#39;to be my coop de grass.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-&#39;,
 &#34;Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn&#39;t expecting you so soon.&#34;,
 &#34; Nono, these guys were just leaving.  weren&#39;t you guys?&#34;,
 &#39;Kyyyle!&#39;,
 &#34;What he means is that he&#39;s jealous that you&#39;ve taken his place as my new &#34;
 &#39;best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.&#39;,
 &#34;Well actually, Butters, I think we&#39;d better hit the hay pretty soon.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, and I&#39;m exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that &#34;
 &#39;nighttime cold medicine you can drink.&#39;,
 &#34; You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It&#39;s the greatest picture ever! Oh my &#34;
 &#39;God!&#39;,
 &#34;Ihit was genius! I waited &#39;til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got &#34;
 &#39;my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his &#39;
 &#39;wiener in my mouth! &#39;,
 &#39;IknowIknow, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? &#39;
 &#39;Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!&#39;,
 &#39;Because that makes Butters gay now!&#39;,
 &#39;Eh- ...what?&#39;,
 &#39; Nuh uh.&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny, that doesn&#39;t make me gay, huh?&#34;,
 &#34;But I&#39;m not g-I&#39;m not gay, you guys!&#34;,
 &#39;No, no, it was a stupid mistake!&#39;,
 &#39;No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse &#39;
 &#39;this?&#39;,
 &#39;How?&#39;,
 &#39; Really?&#39;,
 &#39; ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! &#39;,
 &#39; Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s so fuckin&#39; awesome. You&#39;re gonna be soo stoked. It&#39;s the best surprise &#34;
 &#39;ever!&#39;,
 &#39;You ready?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!&#39;,
 &#39;Hang on a second here. &#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Cause then it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise, would it? &#34;,
 &#34; All right, that&#39;s good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That&#39;s good, just &#34;
 &#39;like that.&#39;,
 &#34;...I swear on my mother&#39;s life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything &#34;
 &#39;yicky in your mouth. &#39;,
 &#39;All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it &#39;
 &#39;comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. &#39;,
 &#39;Uh! &#39;,
 &#39;Haahaahahaha!  Vehhry funny! I suppose you reeeally think you got me!&#39;,
 &#39; I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in &#39;
 &#34;his mouth wouldn&#39;t make me not gay like you said!&#34;,
 &#34; That&#39;s right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put &#34;
 &#34;Butters&#39; wiener in my mouth doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gay! All I have to do is throw &#34;
 &#39;away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will every know. &#39;,
 &#39;Right, except for you.&#39;,
 &#39; Why would you tell anybody?&#39;,
 &#34;...It&#39;s not that funny. There&#39;s lots, there&#39;s lots of things that are way &#34;
 &#39;funnier.&#39;,
 &#34;Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody&#39;s lunch.  &#34;
 &#34;Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy&#39;s face! &#34;,
 &#34; Yes it is!! Now you guys, I&#39;m getting pissed off!! You&#39;d better not tell &#34;
 &#39;anybody!!&#39;,
 &#34;Fine! Whatever! You guys don&#39;t have any proof I put Butters&#39; wiener in my &#34;
 &#39;mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone &#39;
 &#34;trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don&#39;t tell anybody.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh right, like that&#39;s possible! Alright, fine! You know what I&#39;m gonna do, &#34;
 &#34;Kyle?! I&#39;m gonna go home, and photoshop the picture so that it is your face &#34;
 &#34;with Butters&#39; wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to &#34;
 &#34;anybody, I&#39;ll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! &#34;,
 &#39;WHERE IS IT, YOU FILTHY JEW?!&#39;,
 &#39; YOU KNOW GODDAMNED WELL WHAT!!&#39;,
 &#34;I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters&#39; penis in my mouth to &#34;
 &#39;look like Kyle, but it was GONE!  WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY PICTURE?!&#39;,
 &#39; Give it back, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;I swear to God, Kyle, if you don&#39;t give it back right now,  I&#39;m gonna break &#34;
 &#34;your fuckin&#39; Jew legs right here!&#34;,
 &#34;YOU SHUT UP! You&#39;re lying, and  YOU two are covering up for him! You know &#34;
 &#34;what? You&#39;re just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you&#39;re a Jew, and Kenny, &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re a Jew! You&#39;re ALL JEWS!!  OW!  OW!! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!&#34;,
 &#39; Why... why does that matter?&#39;,
 &#34;All right. It&#39;s a picture ...of me.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my &#34;
 &#39;mouth.&#39;,
 &#39;No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my &#39;
 &#39;mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I&#39;m actually looking a the &#34;
 &#39;camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a &#39;
 &#39;thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t have time for that!! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle &#34;
 &#39;is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!&#39;,
 &#34;Sick sonofabitch. He&#39;s gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours &#34;
 &#34;from now.  That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t have a choice. I&#39;m gonna have to bring Mom in &#34;
 &#34;on this one! I&#39;m just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!!&#34;,
 &#34; I, don&#39;t, want to go to school tomorrow.&#34;,
 &#34;Kyle, has a picture of me, and he&#39;s gonna show everyone during Show and &#34;
 &#34;Tell, and, everyone&#39;s gonna laugh at meeee.&#34;,
 &#34;Because, he&#39;s jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he&#39;s gonna show &#34;
 &#39;everyone the picturrrre.&#39;,
 &#39; Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and &#39;
 &#39;I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.&#39;,
 &#39;But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he &#39;
 &#39;pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my &#39;
 &#39;mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so &#39;
 &#39;I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle &#39;
 &#34;took the picture from me, and he&#39;s gonna show it to everybody, and make them &#34;
 &#34;think I&#39;m gaaaaaaay. &#34;,
 &#34; But, Mom, I&#39;ve been trying to get the picture back, but he won&#39;t give it to &#34;
 &#39;meee. &#39;,
 &#39;You, you will?&#39;,
 &#39;It is??  Really?? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! &#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, she&#39;s lying!!&#34;,
 &#34;Mom, you don&#39;t know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!&#34;,
 &#34; Then that&#39;s it. Kyle wins. But he won&#39;t win completely! I&#39;m going to print &#34;
 &#39;out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at &#39;
 &#39;least rob Kyle of his final lie&#39;,
 &#39;Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of &#39;
 &#34;everyone?  Well guess what? I&#39;m not giving you the satisfaction!&#34;,
 &#39;HA!!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very &#39;
 &#34;special, very artsy photographs I&#39;ve taken in pursuit of being a respected &#34;
 &#39;photographer.  This first picture I like to call &#34;Moods of Winter&#34; , a &#39;
 &#39;simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the &#39;
 &#39;brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took &#39;
 &#39;just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A &#39;
 &#39;statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?&#39;,
 &#39;And now this next picture &#39;,
 &#39;And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the &#39;
 &#39;contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which &#39;
 &#39;brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... &#39;
 &#39;controversial. &#39;,
 &#39;Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see &#39;
 &#34;the grain from the high-speed film - there&#39;s sort of a- penis in my mouth &#34;
 &#39;right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.&#39;,
 &#34;What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It&#39;s wrong that we &#34;
 &#34;still have our troops there. It&#39;s WRONG! And what I think that-&#34;,
 &#39; ...Lame.&#39;,
 &#34;Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I&#39;m glad we&#39;re finally gonna &#34;
 &#39;do something about it.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people &#39;
 &#39;can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39; They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where &#39;
 &#39;they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then &#39;
 &#39;they shock your balls. &#39;,
 &#39;This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head &#39;
 &#39;lice home.&#39;,
 &#39;Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?&#39;,
 &#39;Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right??&#39;,
 &#34;Doesn&#39;t matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know &#34;
 &#34;who!  It was Kenny, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;,
 &#39; That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on &#39;
 &#39;that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!&#39;,
 &#39;All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that &#39;
 &#39;we know to stay away from you! &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you&#39;re a liar! &#34;
 &#34;You&#39;re only making this worse on yourself!&#34;,
 &#39;Me??&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what YOU would &#34;
 &#39;do if YOU had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. &#34;,
 &#39;And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! &#39;,
 &#39;All right, lock that door, Craig! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the &#34;
 &#34;head lice.  We&#39;re gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  &#34;
 &#34;Lice feed on a person&#39;s blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small &#34;
 &#34;traces of their saliva in the host&#39;s bloodstream. That saliva, is &#34;
 &#34;monochromagnic. So if an infected person&#39;s blood is touched by... this hot &#34;
 &#34;metal coil, say... that person&#39;s blood will jump 10 meters into the air.&#34;,
 &#39; This is a scientific test, designed to-&#39;,
 &#34;I thought you might say that, Kyle. because you don&#39;t want to take the test, &#34;
 &#39;do you?!&#39;,
 &#34;If it isn&#39;t going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who &#34;
 &#34;wouldn&#39;t want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and &#34;
 &#39;reveal that they were the ones with LICE!&#39;,
 &#34;Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc&#39;s of blood &#34;
 &#39;from each one of you.&#39;,
 &#34;All right, now everyone back over there!  We&#39;ll start with what I already &#34;
 &#39;know. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah? Let&#39;s just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;clean. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all right, it won&#39;t take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! &#34;,
 &#39;Kenny!!&#39;,
 &#39;Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! &#39;,
 &#39;He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  &#39;
 &#39;Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! &#39;,
 &#39;What, Clyde?&#39;,
 &#34;All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny&#39;s gonna &#34;
 &#39;get it!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, &#39;
 &#39;and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!&#39;,
 &#39;Guilty! I thought so! &#39;,
 &#39;All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! SOCK BATH! Everyone wash &#39;
 &#39;Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You&#39;ve known I was the &#34;
 &#39;one with head lice all along, huh?!&#39;,
 &#39;Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap &#39;
 &#39;experiment to frame Kenny?!&#39;,
 &#39;But that means... that means Kenny WAS lying! Sock bath! &#39;,
 &#39;Uh oh! &#39;,
 &#39;Duhude, dude,  not cool!&#39;,
 &#39;Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s wrong??  Has he been checked for bombs?&#34;,
 &#39;No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.&#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, are you on your computer?&#39;,
 &#39;Get online. I need you to check something for me.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!&#39;,
 &#39;Get online now!&#39;,
 &#34;Go to MySpace.  See if there&#39;s a MySpace page for a Bahir Hakeem.&#34;,
 &#39; Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he &#39;
 &#39;have?&#39;,
 &#39; Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s funny.&#34;,
 &#39;He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.&#39;,
 &#39; The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.&#39;,
 &#39; Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve just ID&#39;d a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#39;to get these people out of here now!&#39;,
 &#34;If I wasn&#39;t serious, would I be talking like this?&#34;,
 &#39;Whispeirng, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin&#39; is goin&#39; on?!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah well I don&#39;t like it! It doesn&#39;t follow!&#34;,
 &#34;Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It&#39;s not their M.O. Unless... &#34;
 &#39;Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to &#39;
 &#39;Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!&#39;,
 &#39;Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going &#39;
 &#39;on in town today?!&#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There&#39;s a terrorist in &#34;
 &#39;South Park!&#39;,
 &#39;He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right &#39;
 &#39;away!&#39;,
 &#39;I said I will only talk to the President!&#39;,
 &#39;LALALALALALALALA!&#39;,
 &#34;LALALA-I can&#39;t hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!&#34;,
 &#39;President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?&#39;,
 &#34;Look, I know you&#39;re not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger &#34;
 &#39;right now!&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, I;m at the Clinton rally site, but there&#39;s no sign of that kid!&#34;,
 &#34;Nope, I&#39;m not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. &#34;
 &#39;Did you find the address?&#39;,
 &#34;Jesus, that&#39;s on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I&#39;m going to take &#34;
 &#39;a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s my balls! &#34;,
 &#34; Okay. Okay, Kyle, let&#39;s stay focused here.&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah? &#39;,
 &#39;Yes, Mr. Thompson?&#39;,
 &#39;Why? Did you find something?&#39;,
 &#39; A snuke?&#39;,
 &#34; I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I&#39;m almost there &#34;
 &#39;now; where are you?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh dude, I&#39;m, I&#39;m right next to you. &#34;,
 &#39;Big surprise!&#39;,
 &#39;Let me have time with him.&#39;,
 &#39;We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me &#39;
 &#39;where your son is!&#39;,
 &#39; Where is the detonator?!&#39;,
 &#39; I can do this aaall day.&#39;,
 &#39;You can make it stop!&#39;,
 &#39;Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!&#39;,
 &#39; Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad &#39;
 &#39;farts. &#39;,
 &#39;Where is your son?!&#39;,
 &#39;Answer it! &#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;We got him! I know where he is!&#39;,
 &#34;No no, he&#39;s my lead. &#34;,
 &#39;You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the &#39;
 &#34;detonator! I&#39;m going to find out where it is! &#34;,
 &#39;Uuugh! &#39;,
 &#39; Where is the detonator!&#39;,
 &#39;You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice &#39;
 &#39;farts on your face! One!&#39;,
 &#39;Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! &#39;,
 &#34;Uh, that&#39;s cool. I&#39;m actually not... playing anymore.&#34;,
 &#39;Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s cool. I&#39;m fine with Muslims invading.&#34;,
 &#39;Uhh yes, of course?&#39;,
 &#39;The Russians?&#39;,
 &#39;The Germans?&#39;,
 &#39;The Germans again?&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t possible mean...?&#34;,
 &#39;Well Bahir, I was thinking that maybe I own you an apology.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don&#39;t Because by being &#34;
 &#34;suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else&#39;s. So really, you own &#34;
 &#34;me an apology. But that&#39;s cool.&#34;,
 &#34;But if I hadn&#39;t called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you &#34;
 &#39;would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe? If I hadn&#39;t called you, you wouldn&#39;t have been on your computer &#34;
 &#39;checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved &#39;
 &#39;America.&#39;,
 &#39;Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!&#39;,
 &#39;YES OR NO, KYLE?!&#39;,
 &#34;But that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Bahir, &#34;
 &#39;you get this, right? &#39;,
 &#39;Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you &#39;
 &#39;will suffice.&#39;,
 &#34;And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash&#39;n&#39;Go RC cars, &#34;
 &#39;you got that?! Do you HAVE that?!&#39;,
 &#34;Nono! You don&#39;t ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!&#34;,
 &#39;Bye, Easter bunny! &#39;,
 &#39;Have you lost your mind?&#39;,
 &#34;You guys, you guys, relax. We don&#39;t have to read the book or write the &#34;
 &#39;essay.&#39;,
 &#34;No. There&#39;s people you can hire to do these sorts of things.&#34;,
 &#39;¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?&#39;,

 &#39;Crap! &#39;,
 &#39;Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s great! Let&#39;s hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!&#34;,
 &#34;All right, this time, it&#39;s me and Kenny versus you two assholes.&#34;,
 &#34; Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny&#39;s house.  Get out of here!&#34;,
 &#34;No, Kyle&#39;s right, you guys. We should do something.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah. I know what you&#39;re thinking, Kyle, and I&#39;m with you. I know exactly &#34;
 &#39;what we should do.&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, here we go! Jimmy? &#39;,
 &#39; YES! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  YES!&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s a bunch outside my house too.&#34;,
 &#39;No! Fuck off! &#39;,
 &#39;Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!&#39;,
 &#39;You WHAT??&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah! I can&#39;t possibly jump these many homeless people! I won&#39;t risk it! I &#34;
 &#39;could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many &#39;
 &#39;is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;You see what you did, Kyle?!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re everywhere!&#34;,
 &#34; Aw man, it really smells like Kenny&#39;s house down here.&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.&#39;,
 &#34;All right, all right, look! I didn&#39;t wanna risk it, but... I think I know &#34;
 &#34;what to do. I&#39;ll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on &#34;
 &#39;that roof.&#39;,
 &#34;I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I&#39;ll try &#34;
 &#39;to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.&#39;,
 &#39;I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.&#39;,
 &#39;Coool.&#39;,
 &#39;Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.&#39;,
 &#39;Youu heard about that?&#39;,
 &#39;Thirty was hard enough.&#39;,
 &#39;Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your &#39;

 &#39;condition.&#39;,
 &#34;...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don&#39;t you see how &#34;
 &#34;awesome this is? It&#39;s like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to &#34;
 &#39;getting in trouble.&#39;,
 &#39;Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun &#39;
 &#34;because you&#39;re jealous you didn&#39;t think of it first, well go right ahead, &#34;
 &#39;Kyle.&#39;,

 &#39;Dicktits!&#39;,
 &#34;Shit! Asshole!  &#39;Scuse me. &#34;,
 &#34;Spooge balls bloody vaginal belch.  You guys, don&#39;t laugh. It makes me feel &#34;
 &#39;insecure about my illness.&#39;,
 &#39;Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, don&#39;t you think I wish I could? I&#39;d give anything to be normal like &#34;
 &#39;you. KIKE.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle please! I&#39;m sorry!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, what was that? I I couldn&#39;t quite make that out, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re starry? I I don&#39;t get what you mean by that, Kyle. You&#39;re starry &#34;
 &#34;because uh I don&#39;t want it?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, oh, no, don&#39;t worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I&#39;ve learned to &#34;
 &#34;deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douchebag! And it means a lot that you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew &#39;
 &#39;bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you. Big-nosed kike! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle&#39;s mom&#39;s fat fucking Jew face!  Oh &#34;
 &#34;goodness, &#39;scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. &#34;
 &#34;Got some big things in the works.  Isn&#39;t having Tourette&#39;s awesome? &#34;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39; Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn &#39;
 &#39;Jews! Suck my ass barf! &#39;,
 &#39;Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!&#39;,
 &#34; Yes. It&#39;s all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master &#34;
 &#39;plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say &#39;
 &#39;...horrible things on the air.  Unspeakable things. And people will call me &#39;
 &#39;brave.&#39;,
 &#39; Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble &#39;
 &#39;if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?&#39;,
 &#34; Kyle I&#39;ve won! No matter how you look at it! I&#39;ve managed not only to get &#34;
 &#39;away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bas, at the dinner table, &#39;
 &#39;but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national &#39;
 &#34;television. I&#39;m going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I&#39;m going to call them every &#34;
 &#34;name in the book, and people wlll call it brilliant television. They&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;probably give me an Emmy.&#39;,
 &#39;Then the game is on, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39; Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Big titties! Buttmumch!&#34; There\&#39;s no walls anymore! &#34;Shit!&#34; Whatever enters &#39;
 &#39;my brain I can just say without thinking about it. &#34;I wet my bed last &#39;
 &#39;night.&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Uhh nuh-nothing...&#39;,
 &#39;Hm. That was... weird.&#39;,
 &#34; Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You&#39;ve all been so understanding and &#34;
 &#39;supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of &#39;
 &#39;you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty &#39;
 &#39;sprinkles. &#39;,
 &#34;And I also just want to say that... I&#39;m making this all up!  Uh, I... I...&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at &#39;
 &#34;night because I don&#39;t have a dad.  What the hell is going on?&#34;,
 &#39;No hey ut what, what I meant to say was &#34;asslicker cumballs.&#34; And uhh,  I\&#39;m &#39;
 &#39;secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! &#39;,
 &#39; Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! &#39;,
 &#34; Butters, do you think it&#39;s possible that you can lose the ability to filter &#34;
 &#39;what you say?  I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their &#39;
 &#39;mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! &#39;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! &#34;,
 &#39;Excuse me! Excuse me, I gotta go! I gotta run!&#39;,
 &#34; No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other&#39;s  AAAA &#34;
 &#39;no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my &#39;
 &#39;cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of &#39;
 &#39;year.  Ah, I need to be going now.&#39;,
 &#34; Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin&#39;s WEE-NUH! This sure &#34;
 &#34;has been fun! G&#39;bye! &#34;,
 &#34; Ah, Mr. Hansen? I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do the show.&#34;,
 &#34;My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That&#39;s not true. My &#34;
 &#34;grandma&#39;s fine.&#34;,
 &#34;No I just need to get home. I&#39;m not doin&#39; the show.&#34;,
 &#34; But I&#39;m not gonna do the-&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m, I&#39;m telling you that I&#39;m not doing the show?&#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t understand! All of a sudden, I can&#39;t control what I say.&#34;,
 &#34;No! My Tourette&#39;s has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff &#34;
 &#34;about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it&#39;s gotten really bad.  So ah I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;sorry, but I&#39;m not doin&#39; the show, that&#39;s it. Goodbye. &#34;,
 &#34;Oh, I don&#39;t wanna take a seat!&#34;,
 &#34; No, I&#39;m just gonna go- &#34;,
 &#39; How does he do that?&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I &#39;
 &#34;screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette&#39;s Syndrome, but &#34;
 &#34;see, ah I get it now. You can&#39;t just walk around saying whatever you want. &#34;
 &#39;You gave us a filter because, people don\&#39;t wanna hear things like &#34;I &#39;
 &#39;touched penises with my cousin!&#34;  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you &#39;
 &#34;especially can&#39;t say whatever you want on national televison, &#39;cause, there &#34;
 &#34;could be kids watching. Please, God, don&#39;t make me embarrass myself on &#34;
 &#39;national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, &#39;
 &#39;right? Please, I need a miracle.&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, what are you doing?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!&#39;,
 &#39;You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you &#39;
 &#39;Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got &#39;
 &#39;a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! &#39;,
 &#34;All right, let&#39;s try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  &#34;
 &#39;Last time I saw him he ran right through here. &#39;,
 &#34; It isn&#39;t a story, it&#39;s true! I saw a leprechaun. I&#39;ve seen him come through &#34;
 &#39;here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?&#39;,
 &#39;Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. &#39;,
 &#34;O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there&#39;s a leprechain, you have &#34;
 &#34;to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What&#39;s your six, &#34;
 &#39;Blackei?&#39;,
 &#39;Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in &#39;
 &#39;position! &#39;,
 &#39;Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechaus shows up you must suck &#39;
 &#34;my balls! Don&#39;t forget I have a signed contract from you. &#34;,
 &#34; Goddamnit, why hasn&#39;t it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, &#34;
 &#39;Faggot!&#39;,
 &#39;Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in &#39;
 &#39;five.&#39;,
 &#34;It was here, I swear it! I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not showin&#39; up this time!&#34;,
 &#39; Set off diversion track C! &#39;,
 &#39; Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! &#39;,
 &#34; Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where&#39;s the gold?!&#34;,
 &#39; Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! &#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, suck my balls. &#39;,
 &#39; Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?&#39;,
 &#34;Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn&#39;t it? Well Kyle, shall we go &#34;
 &#39;up to your room for a few minutes.&#39;,
 &#39;Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of &#39;
 &#39;balls in their mouth.&#39;,
 &#39;We had a deal, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; You signed an agreement, Kyle!!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.&#39;,
 &#39;And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!&#39;,
 &#39; I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has &#39;
 &#39;occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly &#39;
 &#39;sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show &#39;
 &#34;any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I&#39;ve given him ample time to &#34;
 &#39;fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry &#39;
 &#34;balls, Your Honor. I&#39;ve provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and &#34;
 &#34;still, my balls remain dry. I want what I&#39;m entitled to!&#34;,
 &#39; Yesss!&#39;,
 &#34;Thank you Your Honor. This isn&#39;t a victory for me, this is a victory for the &#34;
 &#39;justice system. And my balls.&#39;,
 &#39;Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle &#39;
 &#39;arrives.&#39;,
 &#34;He has to. He&#39;s been ordered by the court.&#34;,
 &#39;What? Move aside, move aside! &#39;,
 &#34;Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan&#39;s balls.&#34;,
 &#39;Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey, let go of him! &#39;,
 &#39;No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve got unfinished business. You go through life being told there&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;justice, then you learn that the only real justcie...  is the justice you &#39;
 &#39;take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. &#39;,
 &#39; Previously on Battlestar Galaactica &#39;,
 &#34; Every night, the dream is the same.  I&#39;m on my way to visit my friend Kyle, &#34;
 &#39;because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would &#39;
 &#39;suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. &#34;Time to pay up, Kyle.&#34;  But &#39;
 &#39;then...  &#34;NO! NOOO!&#34;  It\&#39;s been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so &#39;
 &#39;dry they explode like dust. &#39;,
 &#34;NO. I&#39;ve got dry balls. And I&#39;m running out of time.&#34;,
 &#39;Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! &#39;
 &#39;Where is he?! What is going on?!&#39;,
 &#39;Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!&#39;,
 &#39; Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!&#39;,
 &#39;That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechain, &#39;
 &#39;he would suck my balls!&#39;,
 &#39; No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validatd by the United States &#39;
 &#39;court system!&#39;,
 &#39;Theee conference room is which way? &#39;,
 &#39;Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.&#39;,
 &#34;Well we&#39;re here now, that&#39;s all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s right. I guess you&#39;ll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh jeez, I&#39;m sorry, Kyle.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;m so completely bored by this &#34;
 &#34;story. See, I&#39;m really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was &#34;
 &#39;real, and so you have to suck my balls.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I&#39;ve waited a long time for this, and I &#34;
 &#39;intend to savor each and every second. &#39;,
 &#34; Not... just yet, Kyle. There&#39;s still a few things I need to do.  By the &#34;
 &#34;way, I should tell you that I haven&#39;t had a chance to shower while making my &#34;
 &#39;way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...&#39;,
 &#39;I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What &#39;
 &#39;do you think?&#39;,
 &#34;No, you&#39;re right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything &#34;
 &#34;stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you&#39;re sucking my balls, are &#34;
 &#39;you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just &#39;
 &#39;gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?&#39;,
 &#34;In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren&#39;t you? Are you &#34;
 &#39;ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you &#39;
 &#39;are actually- &#39;,
 &#34;Uh, no, no, we&#39;re not done in here yet.&#34;,
 &#39;No! Goddamnit no!&#39;,
 &#34;No! Kyle can&#39;t die. &#34;,
 &#39;Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39; NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come &#39;
 &#39;on, buddy!&#39;,
 &#39; Zap him again!  Do it!&#39;,
 &#39;DO IT!  Come on buddy.&#39;,
 &#39;Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godamnit Kyle, you never walked away from &#39;
 &#39;anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! &#39;
 &#39;Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. &#39;,
 &#39;Wake up, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39; Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s happened? Well, let&#39;s see: You bet me that I couldn&#39;t prove that &#34;
 &#39;leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I &#39;
 &#39;believe.&#39;,
 &#39; You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge &#39;
 &#39;and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and &#34;
 &#34;whipped cream,  let&#39;s see&#34;,
 &#39;Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else &#39;
 &#34;goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that&#39;s right!  &#34;
 &#39;My balls!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they&#39;re gonna nuke it now.  &#34;
 &#39;So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t try to change the subject, Kyle.  You&#39;ve done a really good job of &#34;
 &#34;getting out of this bet, but it&#39;s finally time to settle. Get ready for your &#34;
 &#39;sundae, Kyle. With extra muts. &#39;,
 &#34;Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, &#39;kay? Let&#39;s just go with a 5 &#34;
 &#39;6 8 split&#39;,
 &#39;How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?&#39;,
 &#39;...What?&#39;,
 &#39;Where are you going?!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.&#39;,
 &#39; We had a DEAL KYLE!&#39;,
 &#34;IT ISN&#39;T OVER!!  It isn&#39;t over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you &#34;
 &#39;weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! &#39;
 &#39;Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!&#39;,
 &#34; What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing declaring leprechauns aren&#39;t real?!&#34;,
 &#34;You just can&#39;t declare that imaginary things aren&#39;t real! Who are you to say &#34;
 &#34;what&#39;s real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?&#34;,
 &#34;Look, maybe they&#39;re all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell &#34;
 &#34;and- leprechauns. Maybe they&#39;re all real in the same wway, right?&#34;,
 &#39; No! Leprechauns are real, Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet &#39;
 &#39;after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39;You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about &#39;
 &#39;imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me &#39;
 &#39;think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.  I &#39;
 &#34;why look, it&#39;s me. And...  And there&#39;s Kyle. And, what&#39;s Kyle about to do? &#34;,
 &#34;O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It&#39;s Kyle sucking my &#34;
 &#39;balls! &#39;,
 &#34;O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren&#39;t you? I told you you would &#34;
 &#34;suck my balls before this was over, didn&#39;t I, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. &#39;,
 &#39;Stan, you guys are good! &#39;,
 &#34;Uhh, that&#39;s gay, Mr. Marsh.&#34;,
 &#39;Real guitars are for old people.&#39;,
 &#39; Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God this is so awesome.&#39;,
 &#34;All right, Stan, you&#39;ve got it, man!&#34;,
 &#34;Come on guys. Let&#39;s get out of here. &#34;,
 &#39;Stop cheating, Craig! &#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!&#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, you wanna play me next? &#39;,
 &#34; They can&#39;t do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?&#34;,
 &#34; Yeah, Kyle&#39;s right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh please, I don&#39;t think so, Craig! Chicks think I&#39;m way hotter than you!&#34;,
 &#34;No, because people know I&#39;m not fat! I&#39;m buff. They probably put you at the &#34;
 &#34;bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeath! Or Kenny&#39;s &#39;caure his &#34;
 &#39;poor.&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny, face it: Girls don&#39;t wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they &#34;
 &#39;get married.&#39;,
 &#34;All right, Bebe, let&#39;s see the list.&#34;,
 &#34;You know what I&#39;m talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of &#34;
 &#39;each boy in the class!&#39;,
 &#34;Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny &#39;cause you&#39;d be eating Pop &#34;
 &#39;Tarts for dinner if you married him.&#39;,
 &#39; Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!&#39;,
 &#34;Screw that, dude! We&#39;re guys. We can outthink them.&#34;,
 &#34;All right, here&#39;s what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who&#39;s in charge &#34;
 &#39;of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee &#39;
 &#39;folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. &#39;
 &#34;That&#39;s our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, &#34;
 &#39;Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and &#39;
 &#39;turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the &#39;
 &#39;balls.&#39;,
 &#34;Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she&#39;ll fall to the floor, dropping the &#34;
 &#39;Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee &#39;
 &#39;Chee. Are we good?&#39;,
 &#39;Bail, bail! &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, our mission failed, but we&#39;ve learned a lot. Primarily that girls do &#34;
 &#39;not have balls.&#39;,
 &#39;Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call &#34;Operation: &#39;
 &#39;Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time.&#34; When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for &#39;
 &#39;recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, we&#39;re done talkin&#39; about girls&#39; balls right now! Pay attention! &#34;,
 &#39;We got it! We got it! &#39;,
 &#39;Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! &#39;,
 &#34;What?! That&#39;s bullcrap! &#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re last, dude! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes way! Check it out! &#39;,
 &#34;So? I&#39;m hotter than Kyle.  I&#39;m better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I&#39;m hotter &#34;
 &#34;than Kyyyle! I&#39;m hotter than Kyyyle!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m better-looking than you!  The girls think I&#39;m better-looking than you, &#34;
 &#39;Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I&#39;m hotter than you are.  &#34;
 &#34;Kyle! Kyle, I&#39;m more attractive.  Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39; Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the &#39;
 &#34;other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;stand out so much. Right?  Cool. &#39;,
 &#39;This is bullcrap!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh well, that&#39;s fine! What really matters is the kind of person I am on the &#34;
 &#39;inside.  Oh God damnit. &#39;,
 &#39;AHHHHHH.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34; Nuh, no way. I&#39;m not going to the hospital, mom!&#34;,
 &#34; No, I&#39;m not scared. I just... I don&#39;t want my tonsiils out, that&#39;s all.&#34;,
 &#39; Ice cream?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, you did say free ice cream? &#39;,
 &#34; Uh... it... it&#39;s over?&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s over! I didn&#39;t feel anything. You were right, mom!&#34;,
 &#34;All right, so where&#39;s my ice cream?&#34;,
 &#39;He-you were right, doctor. Everything is okay.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?!&#34;,
 &#39;I have AIDS?!&#39;,
 &#34;Sorry?! You gave me AIDS and you&#39;re sorry?! &#34;,
 &#34;Mom, you said nothin&#39; would go wrong!&#34;,
 &#34;No. No, this is a joke, right?! This is a joke! I can&#39;t have AIDS!!&#34;,
 &#34;Fuck your ice cream, you said I&#39;d be fine!! You all said I&#39;d be fine!!&#34;,
 &#39;No! NOOO!!&#39;,
 &#39; God damnit this sucks ass!!&#39;,
 &#34;Is Kyle laughing out there?! &#39;Cause this isn&#39;t the time for funny jokes! I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;gonna die!&#39;,
 &#39;Not a big deal?! Is that all everyone feels?! People need to understand the &#39;
 &#39;seriousness of this illness! And the bravery of the people who struggle with &#39;
 &#39;it!&#39;,
 &#39;Where the hell is everybody? &#39;,
 &#39;So this is it?&#39;,
 &#34;Well that&#39;s just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when &#34;
 &#34;everyone stops givin&#39; a crap!&#34;,
 &#39;Just bring out Elton John already!!&#39;,
 &#39;Jimmy Buffett?!&#39;,
 &#39;!Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from &#39;
 &#39;the South!!&#39;,
 &#34; Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin&#39; suck!&#34;,
 &#39;Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin&#39; to my AIDS benefit yesterday.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is &#39;
 &#39;still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a &#39;
 &#39;serious disease.&#39;,
 &#34;...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it&#39;s real &#34;
 &#34;fuckin&#39; funny, Kyle!!&#34;,
 &#34;No you don&#39;t!&#34;,
 &#34;If you really felt bad, you&#39;d wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well &#34;
 &#39;any Goddamned second, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!&#39;,
 &#39;Ironic how?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!&#39;,
 &#34; Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It&#39;s awful! And maybe &#34;
 &#39;somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!&#39;,
 &#39; All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. &#39;,
 &#34;Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we&#39;re gonna make him look funny, and then &#34;
 &#34;he&#39;ll know how it feels to be laughed at.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most imprtant things you &#39;
 &#39;can do.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not just sure, Butters. I&#39;m HIV-positive.&#34;,
 &#39; All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; &#39;
 &#34;that&#39;s the easiest access.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ve sneaked into Kyle&#39;s room lots of times.  You think HIV is &#34;
 &#34;something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let&#39;s just see how funny it is &#34;
 &#39;now, asshole. &#39;,
 &#39;Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what &#39;
 &#39;the F?!&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, what?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn&#39;t so funny now, is it?&#34;,
 &#39;Nothing!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. &#39;,
 &#39;Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;Well he was being a total dick! And he&#39;s a big tattle-tale and going around &#34;
 &#39;and talking crap about me!&#39;,
 &#39; Kind of.&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sorry.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;See? He&#39;s tattling again. He hasn&#39;t learned a thing you guys. &#34;,
 &#34; Well Kyle, I guess we&#39;re even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? &#34;
 &#39;Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop &#39;
 &#34;it!  Goddamnit, don&#39;t!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  &#34;
 &#39;NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no no! Not the XBOX, Kyle!  Not &#39;
 &#34;the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I&#39;m sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give &#34;
 &#39;me a chance, and I can cure you!&#39;,
 &#34;No, no, listen, Kyle! I&#39;m on to something. There really is hope.&#34;,
 &#34;Break my XBOX and you&#39;ll never know.&#34;,
 &#39;NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.&#39;,
 &#39;He was a basketball player.&#39;,
 &#34;So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he&#39;s still totally fine! Magic &#34;
 &#34;Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I&#39;ve been &#34;
 &#39;researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and and &#39;
 &#39;isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, &#39;
 &#39;buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!&#39;,
 &#39; My God...&#39;,
 &#39;We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.&#39;,
 &#34;Ah, sir, you don&#39;t understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You &#34;
 &#39;see, we have AIDS.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t you get it?! We are two pals afllicted with an illness, and who only &#34;
 &#39;have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are &#39;
 &#39;stricken with a dieadly disease for no reason!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re not just sure, we&#39;re HIV-positive.&#34;,
 &#34;Forget it, alright?! We&#39;ll use another airline! One that cares! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, well, at least  it&#39;s not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst &#34;
 &#39;disease.&#39;,
 &#34;No you wouldn&#39;t! Look, shouldn&#39;t you be serving people drinks or something?! &#34;
 &#34;Get outta here!  We&#39;re on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.&#34;,
 &#34; I know. I&#39;m scared too.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re not just sure, we&#39;re HIV-positive.&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, we need to find a-&#39;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s funny, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39; Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, &#39;
 &#39;sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... &#39;
 &#39;HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-&#39;,
 &#39; Are you sure!&#39;,
 &#39; Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah well, if there&#39;s a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is &#34;
 &#39;willing to take that risk.&#39;,
 &#39;All right!&#39;,
 &#39; What?! Aw, no!&#39;,
 &#34;What?! Aw, Godddamnit!  Well I&#39;ll tell you this, Kyle. I&#39;m never gettin&#39; my &#34;
 &#39;tonsiils out again, hahahaha.&#39;,
 &#39;What? No. No.  Kyle, no!!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, but we totally don&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#34;Aw dude, that&#39;s our town!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s enough to buy slaves!&#34;,
 &#39; Sweet!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re professionals too, you fuckin&#39; butthole! &#34;,
 &#34; All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin&#39;.&#34;,
 &#39;Cat pee? &#39;,
 &#39;All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  &#39;
 &#39;Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? &#39;,
 &#39;Okay, ready Kenny?&#39;,
 &#39;Ahright, bring out...! The other male cat. &#39;,
 &#39;Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? &#39;,
 &#39; Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right?? Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping &#39;
 &#39;balls.&#39;,
 &#34;Agh Kenny! Knock it off! What&#39;s wrong with you?  Ah, Kenny! &#34;,
 &#34;Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep &#39;cause it pissed me &#34;
 &#39;off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a &#39;
 &#39;diary.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, who has cats these days? &#39;,
 &#39; Mittle Kitty, shhh!  Damnit!  Shhh, Mittle Kitty you have to be quiet, or &#39;
 &#34;else they&#39;re gonna find you.  What?!  It&#39;s the neighbor cat. He hasn&#39;t been &#34;
 &#39;caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend &#39;
 &#34;for himself.  I can&#39;t hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. I&#39;m in trouble enough as &#34;
 &#39;it is.  All right, all right, fine. &#39;,
 &#34;All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can&#39;t hide you all.  &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;ll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. &#39;,
 &#39;Who is it?!&#39;,
 &#39; Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh ohno no, I cannot possibly take in another.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve already taken in the Andersons&#39; cats, and the Willinskys&#39;. There&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;simply nothingn else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for &#39;
 &#39;just this one more...&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell??  Kenny, get out of here!  Aw, fa- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they&#39;ll be put &#34;
 &#34;to death! Something you just can&#39;t understand! &#34;,
 &#34;But you know, we&#39;ve all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute &#34;
 &#34;living beings and force them into hiding. It&#39;s wrong. &#34;,
 &#34; Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, he&#39;s getting super-wated on life.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh God, I&#39;m bored already.&#34;,
 &#39;Gayness! &#39;,
 &#34;We don&#39;t care. *urp.*&#34;,
 &#39;God-damnit, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!&#39;,
 &#39; No! NOOO!&#39;,
 &#39;How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?&#39;,
 &#34; Wait. I&#39;ve got it.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s more people viewing it!&#34;,
 &#34;Ma&#39;am, perhaps you don&#39;t recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid &#34;
 &#39;from YouToob&#39;,
 &#34;Wow, I&#39;ve seen all you guys on the Internet!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.&#39;,
 &#34;Sweet. I think we&#39;re next in line now.&#34;,
 &#39;...You are a homo, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.&#39;,
 &#39;Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!&#39;,
 &#39; Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class &#34;
 &#39;unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All &#39;
 &#34;right, Clyde, you&#39;re first! Get up here!  Yeah, you&#39;re gonna take it, &#34;
 &#39;Clyde. &#39;,
 &#34;Ey! Don&#39;t commend me! It&#39;s the students&#39; fault for being so stupid!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for &#39;
 &#39;my students is catamite to their learning.&#39;,
 &#39;That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need &#39;
 &#39;it most. How much will you pay me?&#39;,
 &#39;Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome &#39;
 &#39;teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.&#39;,
 &#39;Whatever. The class scored super-high on the test.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison&#39;s desk?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah. But whatever, I&#39;m gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city &#34;
 &#39;students and really turns their lives around.&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe he&#39;s right. I&#39;d better be careful how I look.&#34;,
 &#34; Hello students. I&#39;m Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.&#34;,
 &#39;I am here... to teach you calculuuus.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge&#39;,
 &#34;How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can&#39;t get into &#34;
 &#34;college is because you haven&#39;t been taught... how to cheat properly! How do &#34;
 &#39;you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I &#39;
 &#39;mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the &#39;
 &#34;New England Patriots He&#39;s won three Superbowls. How? He cheated. He even got &#34;
 &#39;caught cheeting, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America &#39;
 &#34;it&#39;s okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.&#34;,
 &#34;No no. If you cheat and fail, you&#39;re a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re savvyyy.&#34;,
 &#34;Go ahead, the door&#39;s right there.  Bye-bye, hop onnn, we will miss youuu.  &#34;
 &#39;How do I reach these keeds?&#39;,
 &#39;Nice form, compadre. &#39;,
 &#39;Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup &#39;
 &#39;game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? &#39;,
 &#39; Okay, you start on defense, amigo. &#39;,
 &#34;Ohoooh, that&#39;s one to nothing, amigo!&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the score, ese? Okay, let&#39;s go, your turn.  That&#39;s two to nothing, &#34;
 &#39;amigoo. &#39;,
 &#39;Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, &#39;
 &#39;the scoreboard says two, nothing. &#39;,
 &#39;Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?&#39;,
 &#39;Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material &#39;
 &#39;ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he &#39;
 &#34;do? He videotaped the opposing team&#39;s defense. Think of the defense as your &#34;
 &#34;test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defese. Learn what&#39;s on &#34;
 &#39;the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- &#39;,
 &#39;Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, whne Bill &#39;
 &#39;Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what &#39;
 &#39;every good white cheater says when caught: &#34;I mis-interpreted the rules.&#34; &#39;
 &#39;It\&#39;s what you must also say when caught cheating! &#34;I mis-interpreted the &#39;
 &#39;rules.&#34; Say it with me.&#39;,
 &#39;Good. Again.&#39;,
 &#39;Again!&#39;,
 &#39;Now you sound like white people!&#39;,
 &#39;The answer to #27 is 5.&#39;,
 &#39;The answer to #28 is 14.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the &#39;
 &#34;Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I&#39;ll be right back.  &#34;
 &#34;Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can&#39;t quit now. Come on, what&#39;s wrong with &#34;
 &#39;you?&#39;,
 &#34; How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let&#39;s go get you an abortion.&#34;,
 &#34;Abortioin isn&#39;t wrong! What&#39;s the one thing I&#39;ve been teaching you?&#34;,
 &#34;Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You&#39;re chea-ting nature &#34;
 &#39;itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get &#39;
 &#34;abortionnns when they&#39;re young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go &#34;
 &#39;to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in &#39;
 &#39;their belly right out of a chance at life.&#39;,
 &#39;Mexicans are told not to cheat. &#34;Don\&#39;t cheat! You got pregnant? You have to &#39;
 &#39;raise the child.&#34; So then you have to raise the child while the white girls &#39;
 &#39;get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at &#39;
 &#39;our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh what?&#39;,
 &#34;Ih it&#39;s not for nothing. Ih, if you&#39;re good enough, you can cheat right in &#34;
 &#39;front of them.&#39;,
 &#39;How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Supwerbowl, Bill &#39;
 &#39;Beelichick gathered his football players and said, &#34;Let\&#39;s win this one for &#39;
 &#39;real. Just this one time. Let\&#39;s not cheat.&#34; You know what happened?  They &#39;
 &#39;lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on &#39;
 &#39;chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.&#39;,
 &#39;You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by &#39;
 &#39;reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.&#39;,
 &#39; I reeached these keeeds.&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s be partners, Kenny.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay.  Stan, let&#39;s be partners, dude. &#34;,
 &#34;Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let&#39;s be partners, &#34;
 &#39;Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39; Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a &#39;
 &#39;partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#34;That isn&#39;t necessary!&#34;,
 &#39;You can let go now, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, come on!&#39;,
 &#39;I wanna shoot an Indian.&#39;,
 &#39;Nah, it\&#39;s just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  &#34;Super... &#39;

 &#34;Thyme! They&#39;ve got video games and rides and everything!&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, screw this place! We&#39;ve gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!&#34;,
 &#39;Fine, then let go of my hand!&#39;,
 &#39;Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are &#39;
 &#34;you gonna disobey the teacher&#39;s stupid rule?!&#34;,
 &#34;Fine, then you&#39;re comin&#39; with me!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, let go God-damnit!&#39;,
 &#34;Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don&#39;t let go of my hand, &#34;
 &#34;everyone here is gonna think we&#39;re gay!&#34;,
 &#34;All right Butters, I&#39;ve seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first??&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, we&#39;re going to get back before anybody even notices we&#39;re gone. &#34;
 &#34;Let&#39;s go hit the bumper cars! &#34;,

 &#34; Waiwait, keep- you&#39;re fine.  Oh man, whoa!&#34;,
 &#34;The answer to my prayers, super fun time. Super fun time, you&#39;re all I need.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeheah, we&#39;re wired up!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed. I love you mornin&#39; noon &#34;
 &#39;and night, super fun time&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! &#39;,
 &#39;You make my life so right, super fun time.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw, just a few more things.&#39;,
 &#34;Huh, I guess you&#39;re right, Butters. All right, come on. &#34;,
 &#34;Uhaw man, I can&#39;t wait to see the look on Kyle&#39;s face when we tell him we &#34;
 &#39;had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, you&#39;ve gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, &#39;
 &#39;you could miss it.&#39;,
 &#39; Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.&#39;,
 &#39;They must have realized we left. Damn.&#39;,
 &#39; Shhh! Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, l-listen to me, listen.&#39;,
 &#39;All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we &#39;
 &#39;can say we were inside all along.&#39;,
 &#39;If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, &#39;
 &#39;now let go of my hand.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters?&#39;,
 &#39;All right, come on! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re not gonna find us &#39;til we&#39;re safely back inside.  Look, &#34;
 &#39;see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can &#39;
 &#34;jump to the tree branch, and then we&#39;re home free.&#34;,
 &#34;Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that&#39;s good.  That&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;good, Good, all right then. Let&#39;s head across.  Go easy. Good.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all right. You&#39;ve got it, no problem-  OP.&#34;,
 &#39;Save me!&#39;,
 &#39;... Oh dude, laaame.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can&#39;t help being a douchebag. &#34;
 &#39;Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! &#39;
 &#39;Go!&#39;,
 &#39;Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!&#39;,
 &#39;Ready? Go! &#39;,
 &#34;Sweet, there&#39;s still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, &#34;
 &#34;Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn&#39;t this place been fascinating, Butters?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, I just don&#39;t know what I liked better: the historical buildings and &#34;
 &#39;archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.&#39;,
 &#34;Witty anecdotes, yes, that&#39;s been ab- that&#39;s been awesome.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;d we do? We&#39;ve been here the whole time.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ! &#39;,
 &#39;AAAAH! &#39;,
 &#39; No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!&#39;,
 &#34; They&#39;re gonna... take over the world! HAA! Too many of them.  No! Leave us &#34;
 &#39;alone!  Nooo!  DAMNIT no! No!&#39;,
 &#39;Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.&#39;,
 &#34; They are so! There&#39;s two million of them and their economy is getting &#34;
 &#34;better and with all their advances in technology they&#39;re gonna bring down &#34;
 &#39;America.&#39;,
 &#39; All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all pretend... that &#39;
 &#34;we didn&#39;t see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. &#34;
 &#34;We&#39;ve gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be &#34;
 &#34;okay? Are we just going to... wait until they&#39;ve taken over the world?&#34;,
 &#39; There you are, Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, I need your help.&#39;,
 &#39;The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who &#39;
 &#39;seem to care!&#39;,
 &#34;I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it&#39;s like... everyone&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;doing anything! It&#39;s up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese &#34;
 &#39;now.&#39;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese &#34;
 &#34;outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they&#39;re gonna &#34;
 &#39;kill your parents!&#39;,
 &#34;Because the Chinese hate Americans! That&#39;s why I&#39;ve started: the American &#34;
 &#39;Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese &#39;
 &#39;tyranny.  Will you join me?&#39;,
 &#34; So you&#39;ll join the American Liberation Front?!&#34;,
 &#34; You and me: we&#39;re going to be the brave little boys who fought back, &#34;
 &#39;Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.&#39;,
 &#34;All right Butters, we&#39;re here.  Are you ready?&#34;,
 &#34;This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We&#39;re taking down those Goddamned &#34;
 &#34;Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We&#39;ve got to &#34;
 &#39;inflitrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. &#39;,
 &#34;Because we&#39;re going to make them think... we&#39;re one of them.  Here, put &#34;
 &#39;these teeth in!  And just say &#34;herro&#34; and &#34;prease&#34; a lot.  &#34;Oh, herro &#39;
 &#39;prease.&#34; Ping pong ching chong.&#39;,

 &#39;selling out their own country!&#39;,
 &#39;Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.&#39;,

 &#39;into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are &#39;

 &#34;Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I&#39;m freaked out. I&#39;m freaking &#34;
 &#39;out.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re rightover there, and they&#39;re gonna start screaming and banging on &#34;
 &#34;those drums, and then they&#39;re go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to &#34;

 &#39;Ting ton teetong.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. &#39;,
 &#34;All right, Butters, I think we&#39;ve almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as &#34;
 &#39;soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!&#39;,
 &#34;Ho ho, that&#39;s a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the &#34;

 &#39;Oh my Godd...&#39;,
 &#34;Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don&#39;t... touch us! We know &#34;

 &#39;Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American &#39;
 &#39;Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to &#39;
 &#39;the Chinese!&#39;,
 &#39;Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!&#39;,
 &#39;Shoot him, Butters!&#39;,
 &#34;You have to shoot him, Butters! He&#39;s gonna warn all the Chinese and they&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not cool Butters. You don&#39;t shoot a guy in the dick.&#34;,
 &#34; It doesn&#39;t matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the DICK. Everyone &#34;
 &#34;knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick?? That&#39;s just, that&#39;s just weak. I &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t believe you, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not &#39;
 &#34;us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We&#39;re safe! &#34;,
 &#34; No no, you got it wrong. We aren&#39;t the Chinese, we&#39;re the good gu-  AAH!  &#34;
 &#39;Ohmygodohmygodohmygoddd!&#39;,
 &#39; One of the cops is Chinese! Sonofabitch, how high up does this thing go? We &#39;
 &#34;can&#39;t trust anybody here, Butters!  Don&#39;t come any closer! We have &#34;
 &#39;informationthat that we will only trust with the President of the United &#39;
 &#39;States!&#39;,
 &#34;No! Goddamnit we&#39;re serious! We&#39;ll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a &#34;
 &#39;warning shot, Butters! &#39;,
 &#39;DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!&#39;,
 &#39;God damnit Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is wrong with you?! That is NOT COOL, Butters! That is NOT &#39;
 &#34;COOL!  You don&#39;t fucking do that! You don&#39;t shoot a guy in the dick!&#34;,
 &#34;...It&#39;s NOT okay! Defeating the Chinese won&#39;t mean anything if we do it by &#34;
 &#39;going around shooting people in the dick!  God damnit!&#39;,
 &#39;No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese &#39;
 &#39;supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! &#39;
 &#39;Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at &#39;
 &#39;nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!&#39;,
 &#39;Good! Did you kill him? &#39;,
 &#39;Dude...&#39;,
 &#39;Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. &#39;,
 &#34; You can just deal with the Chinese yourself if that&#39;s how you&#39;re gonna do &#34;
 &#34;it, Butters! I&#39;m out, man.&#34;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you &#34;
 &#34;shove it up your ass.  That&#39;s it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer &#34;
 &#39;conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.&#39;,
 &#34;I really don&#39;t care anymore, Butters. You see, I&#39;ve learned something today. &#34;
 &#39;As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us &#39;
 &#39;into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot &#39;
 &#39;people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be &#39;
 &#34;safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I&#39;d rather us be... &#34;
 &#39;Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. &#39;,
 &#39;She said it again. &#39;,
 &#39; Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?&#39;,
 &#34;Me?? You&#39;re the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy &#34;
 &#39;said boobs can kill people.  GRRR. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialog about breast cancer &#34;
 &#39;awareness, Mr. Garrison.&#39;,
 &#34;Wendy, you need to calm down. You&#39;re gonna get your boobs all angry and &#34;
 &#34;they&#39;re gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I&#39;m on fire today!&#34;,
 &#34;Look out, everyone. There&#39;s some killer titties on the loose.  Could&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;swore I hear them coming through the roof.  &#34;Pssht! Officer! We need to get &#39;
 &#39;an APB out on thos titties! They\&#39;re armed and dangerous!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Not at all.  &#34;Wendy, we\&#39;re gonna get you Wendy. We\&#39;re your boobs, we\&#39;re &#39;
 &#39;gonna kill you!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?&#39;,
 &#34;Haha, you&#39;re gonna kick MY ass?&#34;,
 &#34; You wanna throw down, dawg? I&#39;ll throw down.&#34;,
 &#39; Whassup?  Whassup?&#39;,
 &#34;Standing right here, let&#39;s go, bitch.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gonna fight mee after school?&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re a chick, dude.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh, it&#39;s on, bitch!&#34;,
 &#34;She is NOT gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s already trying to &#34;
 &#39;figure a way to get out of it.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m just gonna teach her a lesson. I&#39;m not gonna totally... kick her &#34;
 &#39;ass. &#39;,
 &#39;Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?&#39;,
 &#39; Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-&#39;,
 &#34; I want to apologize, and tell you that... I&#39;m sorry for what I said. Okay? &#34;
 &#34;It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won&#39;t happen again. I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;,
 &#34; Actually, I was thinking... let&#39;s just keep this between us. I was wrong to &#34;
 &#34;make fun of breast cancer, and I&#39;m very remorsefulness.&#34;,
 &#34; Pfft, apologize?!  That&#39;s not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh Wendy, such a desparate attempt to get out of it. These students are a &#39;
 &#34;little too smart to see you&#39;re just making excuses not to fight me.&#34;,
 &#34; Ohhh, ahhhh... Tha&#39;s funny. You&#39;re gonna die, you  lesbo.  Wendy, seriously &#34;
 &#34;though, I do want to apologize. I&#39;m really sorry and I don&#39;t think we should &#34;
 &#39;fight.&#39;,
 &#39; Wendy. Wendy psst.&#39;,
 &#34;Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you&#39;re not gonna &#34;
 &#39;believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got &#39;
 &#34;what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they&#39;re gonna cut off my &#34;
 &#34;mom&#39;s boobs.&#34;,
 &#39;Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the &#39;
 &#39;fight then I-&#39;,
 &#39; Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.&#39;,
 &#39; My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.&#39;,
 &#39;Eat my underwear?&#39;,
 &#39; Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.&#39;,
 &#39;No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you&#39;ll be satisfied. We can put this &#34;
 &#39;whole thing behind us.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m commited to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how far I will go... &#34;,
 &#39; Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.&#39;,
 &#39;So...  are we cool?&#39;,
 &#39;I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-&#39;,
 &#34; Wendy it isn&#39;t fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what&#39;s up &#34;
 &#39;dawg?&#39;,
 &#39;Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.&#39;,
 &#39;You know, Wendy and I are suppose to fight in like three hours.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, aren&#39;t you worried? Wendy&#39;s a girl. She could end up getting really &#34;
 &#34;hurt, Stan. You&#39;re my bro, and she&#39;s your bitch. I don&#39;t wanna hurt my bro&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;bitch.&#39;,
 &#34;Nu-no, she doesn&#39;t. She told me she doesn&#39;t wanna fight. She&#39;s just stuck, &#34;
 &#34;Stan. Because she knows I&#39;m gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she &#34;
 &#34;doesn&#39;t fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.&#34;,
 &#39;You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Well Wendy, if you\&#39;re so sorry, then say it in front of everyone.&#34; But she &#39;
 &#34;wouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. &#34;
 &#34;You have to be a fuckin&#39; man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a &#34;
 &#34;way-  Oh, that&#39;s where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you&#39;ve got to put a stop &#34;
 &#34;to this fight. Wendy&#39;s stuck and she needs you.&#34;,
 &#34; GOD, YOU ARE SUCH A PUSSY, STAN! YOU&#39;RE SUCH A PUSSY! When I hurt Wendy, &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s gonna be on YOUR FUCKING HEAD! &#34;,
 &#34; Detention! That&#39;s it! &#34;,
 &#34; Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What&#39;s up with that? &#34;,
 &#39; Ahhh, sweet.&#39;,
 &#34;What?! That&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not why I did it.&#34;,
 &#34; Because I&#39;m hardcore. You know, I&#39;m I&#39;m antiestablishment. That&#39;s how I &#34;
 &#39;roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.&#39;,
 &#34;Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;just a bad dude.&#39;,
 &#39; Huh?&#39;,
 &#39; The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat &#39;
 &#39;me up. &#39;,
 &#34;The thing is, Wendy, I really think you&#39;re awesome, and I know I&#39;m just a &#34;
 &#34;nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;have that many friends at schooooooooooool. &#39;,
 &#39;Okay Mommy. Mamamama.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. I mean, I showed up.&#34;,
 &#34; What&#39;s up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.&#34;,
 &#39;Why not? You chicken? &#39;,
 &#34;Pfffft. Aw, that&#39;s a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!&#34;,
 &#34;I ain&#39;t frontin&#39; dawg! Let&#39;s do this! Let&#39;s do it right now, yo.&#34;,
 &#39;Told you guys.&#39;,
 &#39; Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe &#39;
 &#34;enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;somethingn I&#39;d like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully &#34;
 &#39;one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. &#39;,
 &#39;What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?&#39;,
 &#39; Wendy, Wendy.&#39;,
 &#39;Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, get out of here!&#39;,
 &#39; ...Huh? &#39;,
 &#34; What what&#39;s up?  What what&#39;s up?  Wendy, don&#39;t forget: I&#39;ll tell my mom on &#34;
 &#39;you.&#39;,
 &#34;Um, recess is almost over, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s really time.&#34;,
 &#34;All right, fine Wendy!  I&#39;ll fight ya you big bully!&#34;,
 &#34; You don&#39;t have to say anything. I know how it is. I&#39;m no longer the cool &#34;
 &#34;kid. Now you all think I&#39;m a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over &#39;cause &#34;
 &#34;now all the guys don&#39;t think I&#39;m coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not true. You&#39;re just saying that.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re all just saying that to make me feel better.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn&#39;t... Wait, wait a &#34;
 &#39;minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... &#39;
 &#34;unless you do think I&#39;m cool. &#34;,
 &#34; If you&#39;re all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. &#34;
 &#39;Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think &#39;
 &#34;of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I&#39;m cool no &#34;
 &#39;matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! &#39;,
 &#39;Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?&#39;,
 &#39;What girl is gonna see your balls?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their &#39;
 &#39;crappy music sounds the same.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah, me too. &#39;,
 &#39;Shut up already!&#39;,
 &#39;I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  &#39;
 &#39;Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. &#39;,
 &#39;So?&#39;,
 &#39;How much?&#39;,
 &#39;Really? Are you sure?&#39;,
 &#34; Oh my god. We&#39;re gonna make so much fucking money you guys.&#34;,
 &#34;Craig, dude, how&#39;re you doing, bro?&#34;,
 &#34;Kewl, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin&#39; us how your grandma &#34;

 &#39;Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! &#39;,
 &#34;And we&#39;re White.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re being extremely negative, Craig. &#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s no talking to this guy.&#34;,
 &#34;You know what, we&#39;re getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.&#34;,
 &#39;Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. &#39;,
 &#39;What is it?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! &#39;,
 &#39;Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, it&#39;s Craig!&#34;,
 &#34;Well do you mind tellin&#39; us what you&#39;re doing on an ancient Incan wall, &#34;
 &#39;Craig?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s coming from up there.&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, that&#39;s awesome.&#34;,
 &#39; Dude, Craig, we should go back now.&#39;,
 &#39; Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, it&#39;s that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!&#34;,
 &#34;That guy&#39;s an asshole!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? &#39;,
 &#34;Hahahahaha, look at Kenny&#39;s lunch A baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, &#34;
 &#34;Goddamn your family&#39;s poor, dude. &#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s not, there&#39;s not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!&#34;,
 &#39; What the hell are they doing?&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, girls are such fags. &#39;,
 &#39;This... is cool?  This... is cool. We are really old, you guys. &#39;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m out guys.  If this is what&#39;s cool now, I think I&#39;m done. I no &#34;
 &#34;longer have any connection to this world. I&#39;m gonna go home and kill myself. &#34;
 &#39;Goodbye, friends.&#39;,
 &#39;Ehhhhhhh. &#39;,
 &#34;I tried. Went to sleep in my mom&#39;s car in the garage with the engine turned &#34;
 &#39;on.&#39;,
 &#34;...Frickin&#39; hybrids, man. They just don&#39;t do the job anymore. &#34;,
 &#39; God this SUUUCKS!&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck you, Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh God, shut up!&#39;,
 &#39;Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh that&#39;s good that&#39;s good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, &#34;
 &#39;nice.&#39;,
 &#39;No way dude.&#39;,
 &#39;Shut up, Scott Malkinson. &#34;I\&#39;m Scott Malkinson. I\&#39;ve got a lisp and I\&#39;ve &#39;
 &#39;got diabetes.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Don\&#39;t make fun of my diabetes, I\&#39;m Scott Malkinson.&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;&#34;That was supposed to be my powerup pack, I\&#39;m Scott Malkinson and I have &#39;
 &#39;diabetes.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;I told you guys. He&#39;s been watching High School Musical over and over again.&#34;,
 &#34;You shouldn&#39;t pick on kids with diabetes, that&#39;s not cool. I&#39;m Scott &#34;
 &#39;Malkinson.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s a low blow, Stan.&#34;,
 &#34; But he finally got the courage to answer his heart&#39;s call.&#34;,
 &#34;And I like nothin&#39; better than makin&#39; fun of Jews. And ripping off black &#34;
 &#34;people, though some people think it&#39;s rude, but you gotta &#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t stress about it or you just might faint.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh man, you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Goddamn Japs are everywhere. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh, who just shot me? &#39;,
 &#39;U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.&#39;,
 &#34;All right Butters, will you go document the vampires&#39; movements so we know &#34;
 &#39;what their intentions are.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, now get out of here.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters?  Butters?! &#39;,
 &#39;Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a &#39;
 &#39;hickey!&#39;,
 &#39;DUDE! &#39;,
 &#39; U-huh.  Ow.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, &#39;
 &#39;confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.&#39;,
 &#34;Would you look at that? It&#39;s just incredible, isn&#39;t it?&#34;,
 &#39;Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a &#39;
 &#39;girlfriend.&#39;,
 &#34;Her name&#39;s Tammy Warner. She&#39;s the only girl in school whose family is &#34;
 &#34;actually poorer than Kenny&#39;s. It&#39;s... really kind of beautiful if you ask &#34;
 &#39;me.&#39;,
 &#34; Butters, what&#39;s the problem?&#34;,
 &#34;That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she&#39;s just gonna throw it in &#34;
 &#39;his face!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny.  Your girlfriend is... a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named &#39;
 &#39;Dave Darsky a BJ in the parking lot of TGI Fridays.&#39;,
 &#34;Your girlfriend&#39;s a slut, dude.&#34;,
 &#39; He took it pretty well.&#39;,
 &#39;The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you?! &#39;,
 &#34; KENNY! You&#39;re gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener?! Do you know &#34;
 &#34;how disgusting that is?! Girls&#39; mouths are full of germs!&#34;,
 &#34; Just because you have condoms doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re safe, Kenny! &#34;
 &#39;Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the &#39;
 &#34;mouth of an American woman! And you&#39;re gonna let that near your penis?!&#34;,
 &#34;Well well well, here he comes. It&#39;s BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.&#34;,
 &#39;Purity ring?&#39;,
 &#34; Grey&#39;s Anatomy?? Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!&#34;,
 &#39; Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high &#39;
 &#34;sniffin&#39; paint? Kenny?&#34;,
 &#39; Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings.&#34; These Disney &#39;
 &#39;douchebags are the ones causing all this! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!&#39;,
 &#34;This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you&#39;re doin&#39; now! You&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;tryin&#39; to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh &#34;,
 &#39;The hell did you do to us?!&#39;,
 &#34; I told him... A woman&#39;s mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I &#34;
 &#39;said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I &#39;
 &#39;said.&#39;,
 &#39;And knowing is half the battle.&#39;,
 &#34; The city isn&#39;t what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went &#34;
 &#34;to crap. It&#39;s like... everyone&#39;s sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad &#34;
 &#39;economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had &#39;
 &#39;to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to &#39;
 &#34;change things.  He didn&#39;t.  As more and more people turned to crime and &#34;
 &#39;violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs &#39;
 &#39;protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans &#39;
 &#34;and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I&#39;ve &#34;
 &#34;chosen to become more than a man.  I&#39;m the hero this town needs. I am...  &#34;
 &#39;the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order &#39;
 &#39;intact. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved &#39;
 &#39;by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.&#39;,
 &#39;I know, right??  &#34;Who is the Coon?&#34; It\&#39;s what everyone must be asking &#39;
 &#39;themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking.the law into their &#39;
 &#34;own hands. As for me, I certainly don&#39;t agree with the Coon&#39;s reckless ways. &#34;
 &#34;If you ask me, there&#39;s no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the &#34;
 &#39;Coon is a menace.&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not a fag!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I&#39;m just... I&#39;m just mad &#39;cause you should never &#34;
 &#39;use the term &#34;fag,&#34; Kyle. That\&#39;s a hate word. And it\&#39;s insensitive to butt &#39;
 &#39;pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you &#39;
 &#34;think he&#39;s the savior this town needs or do you think he&#39;s a dangerous &#34;
 &#39;vigilante?  Kenny?&#39;,
 &#39;And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a &#39;
 &#39;hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really &#39;
 &#39;cool, we should also be asking each other... &#34;Why does he care so much for &#39;
 &#39;the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid &#39;
 &#39;our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?&#34; What we all need &#39;
 &#39;now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we &#39;
 &#39;all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from &#39;
 &#34;approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreen&#39;s. I &#34;
 &#34;know I&#39;ll be there with my camera. And I&#39;m sure... many of you will, too.&#34;,
 &#39; Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a &#39;
 &#34;superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, &#39;cause only they &#34;
 &#34;knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreen&#39;s.  No, stop. Can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important &#39;
 &#34;day in the Coon&#39;s life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes &#34;
 &#39;down to tomorrow. Concentrate&#39;,
 &#39; Hunh!&#39;,
 &#34;I got boned! That&#39;s what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even &#34;
 &#39;notices!&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t tell you what happened &#39;cause it&#39;s about my super secret double &#34;
 &#39;life!&#39;,
 &#39; Wha, what?&#39;,
 &#39; What?!&#39;,
 &#34;Fuckin&#39; butthole!&#34;,
 &#39;You gotta be kidding me!&#39;,
 &#39; AAAAAHT!! &#39;,
 &#39;So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!&#39;,
 &#39;Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! &#39;,
 &#39;Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in &#39;
 &#39;your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!&#39;,
 &#39;What?! Why?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking &#34;
 &#39;pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!&#39;,
 &#39; Fucking bitch...&#39;,
 &#34; Oh my God, look everyone, it&#39;s the Coon!&#34;,
 &#39;And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is &#39;
 &#39;obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our &#39;
 &#39;money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret &#39;
 &#39;Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my &#39;
 &#39;friends, who are oft-&#39;,
 &#39; Heng!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had &#39;
 &#39;to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Heng!&#39;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t you fratenize me! This is all your fault, you know!&#34;,
 &#39;The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!&#39;,
 &#39;Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: &#39;
 &#39;Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand &#39;
 &#39;Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. &#39;,
 &#39;Did somebody say &#34;catch a Jew&#34;? The person you\&#39;re after might be hard to &#39;
 &#39;get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft &#39;
 &#39;Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.&#39;,
 &#34; All right, whoever is thinkin&#39; of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin&#39; again! If &#34;
 &#34;somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you&#39;re b-you&#39;re being a &#34;
 &#39;dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;-from here and I thought that day would never end!&#39;,
 &#34;Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody&#39;s face, Superhard! But you don&#39;t know who &#34;
 &#34;until this week&#39;s episode!&#34;,
 &#34;No! No, nono, you&#39;re right Bebe! Farts totally aren&#39;t funny. &#34;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s get to my house!! &#34;,
 &#34; Ah ah ah, that&#39;s my seat, Craig.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s my Goddamend house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! &#34;,
 &#39;What??&#39;,
 &#39;What the fuck is this?!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!&#39;,
 &#34;No! No! As a matter of face, I will not hold! I&#39;ve been on hold for &#34;
 &#34;thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that&#39;s what we &#34;
 &#39;want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip &#39;
 &#39;conclusion, you asshole?!&#39;,
 &#34;You wanna tell me what&#39;s funny about two women shooting air from their &#34;
 &#34;vagina into a man&#39;s face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you &#34;
 &#39;showed that!&#39;,
 &#39;Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind &#39;
 &#39;of filth on television?! &#39;,
 &#39;You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of &#39;
 &#34;network are you running there in Canada?! Don&#39;t call me boddy! I&#39;m not your &#34;
 &#39;buddy! &#39;,
 &#39;And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has &#39;
 &#39;thusly...&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, that&#39;s good.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Biutters. How you holding up, man?&#39;,
 &#34;We got you a present, Butters. I&#39;ll put it here on your nightstand &#39;cause &#34;
 &#39;none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make &#34;
 &#39;people open their eyes.&#39;,
 &#34;Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend&#39;s face. That &#34;
 &#34;is why we are here to tell you  it&#39;s not a joke.&#34;,
 &#39;Sick! Stop it, lady!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin&#39;? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, &#34;
 &#34;but they&#39;re all pissed off at me for somethin&#39; so I have to hang out with &#34;
 &#39;you.&#39;,
 &#39; Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some &#39;
 &#39;stuff together.&#39;,
 &#34; No, that&#39;s not that funny. Let&#39;s try something else.&#34;,
 &#34;No, no. Polacks aren&#39;t that funny dude. Try somethin&#39; else. &#34;,
 &#39;Meh. &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, if I&#39;m trying to be creative, I can&#39;t eat fruit. Doesn&#39;t your mom have &#34;
 &#39;something more substantial to eat?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I like fishsticks.&#39;,
 &#39;What, dude, you got something?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#34; Fish dicks! Aw dude, that&#39;s funny as shit! I think we&#39;re really onto &#34;
 &#34;something here. Let&#39;s try it out on the guys.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.&#39;,
 &#39;Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?&#39;,
 &#39;Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?&#39;,
 &#39; What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?&#39;,
 &#39;Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?&#39;,
 &#39; Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your &#39;
 &#39;mouth?&#39;,
 &#39;What are you?&#39;,
 &#34;And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that&#39;s our joke on &#34;
 &#39;national television.&#39;,
 &#34;Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren&#39;t! Ha ha &#34;
 &#34;ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I&#39;ve been thinking: We&#39;ve got to patent the fishsticks &#34;
 &#39;joke.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah dude, there&#39;s lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. &#34;
 &#39;We should be getting compensated.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people&#39;s amusement, but I &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t work for free. I&#39;m gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what&#39;s coming to &#34;
 &#39;us! &#39;,
 &#39; Motherfucker!&#39;,
 &#39;Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up &#39;
 &#34;some patent papers. We&#39;ve got to sign these so that people know that the &#34;
 &#39;joke belongs to you and me!&#39;,
 &#34;But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn&#39;t do!&#34;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#34;Jimmy, that&#39;s messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don&#39;t you &#34;
 &#39;remember?&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?&#39;,
 &#34;Team up? Okay, let&#39;s write some jokes together.&#34;,
 &#39;Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look &#39;
 &#34;out, Jimmy, it&#39;s a black widow! &#34;,
 &#34;Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn&#39;t even relevant. &#34;
 &#39;We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re no better than a Jew.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s cool man, it&#39;s cool. &#34;,
 &#39;Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know what to do about Jimmy. I&#39;m starting to think he &#34;
 &#39;might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need &#39;
 &#39;you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did &#39;
 &#39;come up with it. &#39;,
 &#39;You do?&#39;,
 &#34; But, I&#39;m sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn&#39;t I?&#34;,
 &#34;Hey Jimmy, what&#39;s up dawg?&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s cool. You wanna write some together? &#34;,
 &#34; Cool, thanks. Let&#39;s get to work! Now let&#39;s see... something that&#39;s a play &#34;
 &#34;on words, I don&#39;t know... fishsticks. You know, &#39;cause it, &#39;cause dicks&#34;,
 &#39;Oh thank you Mrs. Valmor.  Now let\&#39;s see... The setup could be... &#34;Do you &#39;
 &#39;like fishsticks?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;So then I can say, &#34;What are you, a gay fish?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a dragon of some kind! Don&#39;t worry, I can save you all! &#34;,
 &#39;Thanks you guys!&#39;,
 &#39;Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy &#39;
 &#34;doesn&#39;t try and Jew me over.&#34;,
 &#39;Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. &#39;
 &#39;Thank you.&#39;,
 &#39;Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the &#39;
 &#39;other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it &#39;
 &#34;goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you&#39;ve got a good &#34;
 &#39;joke. Thank you.&#39;,
 &#39;Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us &#39;
 &#34;before. I mean let&#39;s be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn&#39;t work with &#34;
 &#34;someone who&#39;s disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with &#39;
 &#39;crippled people is really ...important. &#39;,
 &#34;Ahaw don&#39;t cry, pal. You&#39;re gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really &#34;
 &#39;important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure everyone knew that we &#39;
 &#39;came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.&#39;,
 &#39;Uhhh excuse me? &#39;,
 &#34;Alright, so check it out: We&#39;ve got offers from Van de Kamp&#39;s and Gorton&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;Fisherman to do commercials.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, that was kewl huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Whassat?&#39;,
 &#39;So... here it is.&#39;,
 &#39;That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the &#39;
 &#34;fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it&#39;s Puff Daddy!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, so now it&#39;s we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all &#34;
 &#39;yourself!&#39;,
 &#39;Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how &#39;
 &#39;it happened?!&#39;,
 &#39;Hello Jim.&#39;,
 &#39; What are you up to?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. &#39;,
 &#34;Now let&#39;s see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. &#34;
 &#34;You know, &#39;cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.&#34;,
 &#39;Thanks.  So, what I\&#39;m thinking is, &#34;Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! &#39;,
 &#39;Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  &#34;Like fishsticks in &#39;
 &#39;your mouth? What are you a gay fish?&#34; There! &#39;,
 &#39;Aw damnit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve gotta let Jimmy go, it&#39;s all my fault.&#34;,
 &#39;Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my &#39;
 &#39;God, wait. I totally get it now.&#39;,
 &#34;All this time I&#39;ve been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the &#34;
 &#34;credit, but, now I realize it&#39;s just that your ego has made you believe &#34;
 &#34;things happened differently. That&#39;s what Kyle was trying to tell me. That &#34;
 &#39;you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a &#39;
 &#39;part of things.&#39;,
 &#39;I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but &#39;
 &#39;now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack &#39;
 &#34;that no matter what people tell them, they can&#39;t accept the truth of who &#34;
 &#34;they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can&#39;t help &#34;
 &#34;believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won&#39;t let you think &#34;
 &#39;otherwise. I just have to accept that.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy &#39;
 &#34;town and live the life we&#39;ve all dreamed of!&#34;,
 &#34;Haven&#39;t you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. &#34;
 &#34;Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we&#39;ve all dreamed about! &#34;
 &#34;And it&#39;s all happening right here:  Somalia.&#34;,
 &#39;North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. &#39;
 &#39;Waterfalls and jewelled treasure underneath.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, &#34;
 &#34;then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it&#39;s just a 49-hour bus ride into &#34;
 &#39;Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.&#39;,
 &#39;Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;trying to trick me somehow.&#39;,
 &#34;Then why don&#39;t you wanna go?&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s true. Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve finally come to terms with your &#34;
 &#34;disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I&#39;m off to start planning! &#34;,

 &#34;Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can&#39;t even keep them straight. &#34;

 &#39;The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. &#39;
 &#34;Alright, sooo, here&#39;s how we&#39;ll do this, guys. I&#39;ll come out to the ring &#34;

 &#39;I\&#39;m gonna say &#34;You slept with my girlfriend,&#34; and I\&#39;ll charge you into a &#39;
 &#39;head slap.&#39;,
 &#39;Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like &#34;No no, the fight hasn\&#39;t &#39;
 &#39;started yet,&#34; and that\&#39;s when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over &#39;
 &#39;the head with a foldaway chair.&#39;,
 &#39;Noo, let\&#39;s save the &#34;girlfriend is a whore&#34; line until after Stan headbutts &#39;
 &#39;Butters for trying to stop the fight again.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright are you ready to try this, guys?&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, let&#39;s start wrestlin&#39;. &#34;,
 &#39;You slept with my girlfriend, Hamemrclaw! &#39;,

 &#39;bell, miste- ah!&#39;,
 &#39; Wait for it, wait for the whore line.&#39;,
 &#39;And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!&#39;,
 &#39;I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have &#39;
 &#39;brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!&#39;,
 &#34;Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It&#39;s true, I love Stan &#34;
 &#39;the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. &#34;,
 &#34;Do you know what it&#39;s like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ve had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not in love with you, I&#39;m in love with abortions. Don&#39;t you undestand?! &#34;,
 &#34;Alright you guys, let&#39;s bring it in.  I think we&#39;ve done a really great job &#34;
 &#34;and let&#39;s just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun &#34;
 &#39;out there, okay?&#39;,
 &#39;O what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moone sets upon the tops of the &#39;
 &#39;tress and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the &#39;
 &#39;excitement of violence.&#39;,
 &#34; You guys! You guys, listen to this! It&#39;s amazing!&#34;,
 &#39;We just received a letter from the WWE.&#39;,
 &#39;GentlemenWe have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested &#39;
 &#39;in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be &#39;
 &#39;sending a telent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event &#39;
 &#39;this Saturday the twenty-fourth.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly &#39;
 &#39;three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up &#39;
 &#39;and work it like never before.&#39;,
 &#34;Thanks for coming, guys. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;ve called you here &#34;
 &#39;to Sizzler.&#39;,
 &#39;Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.&#39;,
 &#39;And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, &#39;
 &#39;right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown &#39;
 &#39;a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, let&#39;s face it: they can&#39;t wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I &#34;
 &#39;wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And &#39;
 &#34;Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he&#39;s the worst wrestler I&#39;ve ever seen!&#34;,
 &#39;Right?&#39;,
 &#34;No dude, they&#39;re gonna hurt our chances.&#34;,
 &#34;Because we all know that the new material I&#39;ve written is stuff those guys &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t handle, and we&#39;ll suffer from it!&#34;,
 &#34;Yep. We&#39;ve gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult &#34;
 &#39;roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.&#34;,
 &#34;Number seventeen step forward, please?  You&#39;re wrestling a Muslim immigrant. &#34;
 &#39;You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 &#39;
 &#39;attacks. Go!&#39;,
 &#34;Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You&#39;re wrestling for the right to marry &#34;
 &#39;Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, &#39;
 &#39;go!&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you. &#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just &#34;
 &#39;wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about &#39;
 &#39;yourself?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, this guy crushes.&#39;,
 &#39; Alight, places everyone.&#39;,
 &#39; Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. &#39;,
 &#39;My man can do whatever he wants.&#39;,

 &#39;You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!&#39;,
 &#39;O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!&#39;,

 &#39;as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby &#39;
 &#39;where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, what about us? Our show? &#39;,

 &#39; Excuse me. EXCUSE ME! HEY ASSHOLES!!  You guys know that everyone thinks &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re total fags, right.&#34;,
 &#39;You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily &#39;
 &#34;loud motorcycles thinking you&#39;re all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at &#34;
 &#39;you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?&#39;,
 &#39;No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people &#39;
 &#39;who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as &#39;
 &#39;possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you &#39;
 &#34;know, you&#39;re fuckin&#39; fags. &#34;,
 &#34;But Cartman isn&#39;t letting up on him. &#34;,
 &#39;Agreed.&#39;,
 &#39;Ni-nice, okay.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;I think what I&#39;m gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, &#34;
 &#39;crap on their seats.&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, I think that&#39;ll be nice.&#34;,
 &#39;I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, &#39;
 &#39;probably ...four cartons of gravy.&#39;,
 &#39;That was us!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, they think we meant gay fags.&#39;,
 &#34;Then he&#39;s a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?&#34;,
 &#39;You call them &#34;bike-curious&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over &#39;
 &#39;the country.&#39;,
 &#39;Emmanuel Lewis, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;No! That&#39;ll just make you bigger fags!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh it&#39;s over, it&#39;s finally over! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh. My. Goodddd.&#39;,
 &#34;Soo, you&#39;re uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?&#34;,
 &#34; He stuttered like a bitch! I&#39;ve got this job in the bag!  Who are you?&#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?&#39;,
 &#34;Well it&#39;s just that...  that&#39;s what that Caey kid said about your hairpiece?&#34;,
 &#39;Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And &#39;
 &#39;I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to &#39;
 &#34;Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the schold ay today. Hm, doesn&#39;t seem &#34;
 &#34;like they us a lot of notice on that, uh, &#39;kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, &#34;
 &#39;the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold &#39;
 &#39;sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served &#39;
 &#39;hot food? I mean, What has happened to our school? This school is &#39;
 &#39;transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership &#39;
 &#34;that doesn&#39;t care! I&#39;m talking of course about our student body president, &#34;
 &#39;Wendy Tetstaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, &#39;
 &#39;this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regine where &#39;
 &#39;students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due &#39;
 &#39;to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium &#39;
 &#39;instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music &#39;
 &#39;room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school &#39;
 &#39;has a fiftenn-year old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning &#39;
 &#34;this whole place into Communist Russia!  It&#39;s not a coincidence that once &#34;
 &#39;Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your &#39;
 &#34;teachers don&#39;t wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, &#34;
 &#39;because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all &#39;
 &#39;corners.&#39;,
 &#34;But hey, I&#39;m just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And &#34;
 &#34;because I&#39;m brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy &#34;
 &#39;using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t want my lunch money going to drugs! Who&#39;s taking these drugs? What &#34;
 &#34;would be the point? I&#39;m asking questions!&#34;,
 &#39;You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?&#39;,
 &#34;Oohhhh I get it. You&#39;re trying to silence me! You&#39;re scared that somebody is &#34;
 &#39;standing up to this school and its president for once!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes &#39;
 &#39;that one day?!&#39;,
 &#34;You just want somebody to read what&#39;s in front of them like a brain-washed &#34;
 &#34;zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am NOT Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I&#39;m not some &#34;
 &#34;dog on a leash that just blindly says what he&#39;s told, until he&#39;s killed!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh I will! And maybe I&#39;ll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a &#34;
 &#34;student is being told not to speak out against his school! I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;find that very interesting!&#39;,
 &#39;Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning &#39;
 &#39;announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is &#39;
 &#39;of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal &#39;
 &#39;soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? &#39;
 &#34;She IS supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She&#39;s lying &#34;
 &#34;to everyone? Or is she? Let&#39;s ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk &#34;
 &#34;briefly about the state of our school&#39;s economy. The bake sale last week was &#34;
 &#39;a coplete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted &#39;
 &#34;for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn&#39;t. And everyone who did is now &#34;
 &#39;scratching their heads and goin\&#39; &#34;Whoops. Guess I shouldn\&#39;t have done &#39;
 &#39;that.&#34;  I\&#39;m not in the student council, I\&#39;m just a normal kid like all of &#39;
 &#39;you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened ...to my school.&#39;,
 &#39;-of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy &#39;
 &#39;Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole-&#39;,
 &#34;Goood morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  &#39;
 &#39;you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.&#39;,
 &#39;Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and &#39;
 &#34;you know it. You feel it. You&#39;re like, you&#39;re like me; you wanna change it. &#34;
 &#34;But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger&#39;s not gonna let that happen! This is not the &#34;
 &#34;school we grew up in, and ...and I don&#39;t know if we can get it back.  So &#34;
 &#34;let&#39;s take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what &#34;
 &#34;is she trying to achieve? Let&#39;s just take a look at these Keywords here: &#34;
 &#34;Wendy&#39;s made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist &#34;
 &#39;and Liberal place! But you see whatn that happens, what we get is a &#39;
 &#39;Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look &#39;
 &#39;closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our &#39;
 &#39;school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;turning into, but unless you ask why , we&#39;re gonna transform into something.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Thank you&#34; and this is to..?&#39;,
 &#39; &#34;To Douglas.&#34; There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick &#39;
 &#39;up your copy.&#39;,
 &#39;Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, well now you can read about all those things I&#39;ve said, Butters. Take &#34;
 &#39;this copy of my book.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;ll be five dollars.&#34;,
 &#39;A book signing.&#39;,
 &#34;I do not directly say she&#39;s a slut!&#34;,
 &#34; You didn&#39;t read the rest, dude.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Or does she?&#34; See, that\&#39;s a question. I\&#39;m asking questions, Stan! I\&#39;ve &#39;
 &#34;called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won&#39;t do it!&#34;,
 &#39;You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she&#39;s president she can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;be written about?&#39;,
 &#34;And what if they are?! You&#39;ll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces &#34;
 &#39;you to?!&#39;,
 &#39;Just enough power to foce you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re a lackey, Mackey!&#34;,
 &#39;Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This &#39;
 &#39;school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student &#39;
 &#34;isn&#39;t free! Well I&#39;m not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i&#39;m walking out and I&#39;m never &#34;
 &#39;coming back! &#39;,
 &#39;Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our &#39;
 &#34;school. I was so... fed up with our president&#39;s hypocrisies, me not being &#34;
 &#39;able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still &#39;
 &#39;upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live &#39;
 &#39;with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to &#39;
 &#39;understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary &#39;
 &#34;of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. &#39;,
 &#39;The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their &#39;
 &#34;art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;forefathers. Of coursre, it wasn&#39;t long before ...I fell in love with &#34;
 &#34;Smurfette.  We&#39;re from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common &#34;
 &#39;language of passion.&#39;,
 &#34;Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn&#39;t a real Smurf &#34;
 &#39;and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by &#39;
 &#39;picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, &#39;
 &#39;all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into &#39;
 &#39;the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.&#39;,
 &#39;And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah &#39;
 &#39;well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is &#39;
 &#39;dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You &#39;
 &#34;won&#39;t see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I&#39;m being silenced, I&#39;m not allowed &#34;
 &#39;time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances With Smurfs &#39;
 &#39;available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What &#39;
 &#39;happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.&#39;,
 &#39;People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.&#39;,
 &#34;Of course. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park &#34;
 &#39;Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school &#39;
 &#39;play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving &#39;
 &#39;meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of &#39;
 &#39;South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank yuo for coming on the &#39;
 &#39;show.&#39;,
 &#39;Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope &#39;
 &#34;you don&#39;t take offense to it.&#34;,
 &#39;How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? &#39;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.&#34;,
 &#39;Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?&#39;,
 &#39;If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? &#39;,
 &#39;You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever &#34;
 &#34;happened? Is that what you&#39;re suggesting?&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?&#39;,
 &#39;What? What do you mean I know that?&#39;,
 &#39;No! You wiped them all out!&#39;,
 &#39;Wait, hold on, can we take a break?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you can&#39;t take my Dances With Smurfs idea and turn it into your own &#34;
 &#39;thing-&#39;,
 &#34;No! No, dude! You don&#39;t just take one person&#39;s story and then add a couple &#34;
 &#39;of things and call it yours!&#39;,
 &#39;You sold the movie rights to who?!&#39;,
 &#34;Theh- They can&#39;t do that! I&#39;m student body president!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh Goddamnit! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! &#39;
 &#34;Dances With Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can&#39;t just take Dances With &#34;
 &#39;Smurfs and call it something else! &#39;,
 &#39;Huh!&#39;,
 &#34;No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can&#39;t also &#34;
 &#39;be the morning announcement reader!&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was &#34;
 &#39;talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student &#39;
 &#34;council&#39;s retarded! &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m doin&#39; the best I can! &#34;,
 &#39;We/re going to the water park, The water park, the water park. We/re going &#39;
 &#34;to the water park, Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;like. &#39;,
 &#34;This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven&#39;t been to the waterpark in like, &#34;
 &#39;over a year.&#39;,
 &#34;No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It&#39;s so dope, as long as there &#34;
 &#34;aren&#39;t any minorities.&#34;,
 &#34;You know, there&#39;s always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts &#34;
 &#39;in the wave pool, pisses me off.&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go!&#34;,
 &#39; Six adorable children please.&#39;,
 &#39;Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! &#39;,
 &#39; Forget it! Just forget it! &#39;,
 &#39;What has happened to this place? I don’t recognize it anymore. It used to be &#39;
 &#39;so fun and special. What is life worth living for? The dream is dead, our &#39;
 &#39;land is gone; There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on. There are too &#39;
 &#39;many minorities (minorities) At my water park (my water park). This was our &#39;
 &#39;land, our dream (our dream), and they’ve taken it all away. They just keep &#39;
 &#39;coming and coming (minorities). I tried to go and tell the police, But even &#39;
 &#39;the authorities Are minorities At my water park. There’s no place for me to &#39;
 &#39;sit anymore, And the lines just keep getting crazier. There are Mexicans all &#39;
 &#39;around me. The lazy river has never been lazier. It’s a 40 minute wait to go &#39;
 &#39;down one slide, And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!&#39;,
 &#39;Just do it in English!&#39;,
 &#39;There are too many minorities (too many) At my water park (somebody do &#39;
 &#39;something). Where did they all come from? Why can’t they leave this land &#39;
 &#39;alone? And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying). We looked the other &#39;
 &#39;way too long. We’ve got to change our priorities And get all these &#39;
 &#39;minorities Out of my water park (Minorities) Mexicans and Asians, (Black &#39;
 &#39;people), I think I even saw Native Americans (gross). God I’m asking please, &#39;
 &#39;get all of these minorities Out of my water park (my water park).&#39;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans &#34;
 &#39;here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!&#39;,
 &#39;So?! Guess how many people are at the water park today? One hundred and &#39;
 &#39;forty three! There are actually more minorities here than US!&#39;,
 &#39;...What do you mean?&#39;,
 &#39;The black and brown people.&#39;,
 &#39;Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some &#39;
 &#39;calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people &#39;
 &#34;to minorities. That&#39;s fifty percent rise in one, year!&#34;,
 &#34;Because it&#39;s important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three &#34;
 &#34;years the world will be only... minorities. That&#39;s 2012! The Mayans &#34;
 &#39;predicted this!&#39;,
 &#39;The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year &#39;
 &#34;2012! And now it&#39;s happening!&#34;,
 &#39;You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks &#39;
 &#34;like at least you&#39;ve got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna &#34;
 &#39;do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?&#39;,
 &#39;Help! Help!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I&#39;m just a little boy! You have to help me!  &#34;
 &#39;Oh, oh, oh. &#39;,
 &#39;Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.&#39;,
 &#39; Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got &#39;
 &#39;wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species &#39;
 &#34;alive. Now it&#39;s jsut me, all alone, with minorities. What will the &#34;
 &#34;minorities do with me? I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what on all of their minds. I have to &#34;
 &#39;make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does &#39;
 &#39;anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. &#39;,
 &#39;It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking &#39;
 &#39;is &#34;Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this &#39;
 &#39;minority-run world?&#34; When the smoke has cleared I\&#39;m sure the minorities &#39;
 &#39;will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. &#39;
 &#39;Nooo... &#39;,
 &#39;I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.&#39;,
 &#39;...because I was so happy when I sen that movie.&#39;,
 &#39;Noooo...  Trying to find a job was even harder.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, I do just as much work.&#39;,
 &#39;Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.&#39;,
 &#39;Noooo...&#39;,
 &#34; NO! No I don&#39;t wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is &#34;
 &#39;cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! &#39;,
 &#34;Guys? Guys!  Oh it&#39;s true! You all did survive!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! &#39;
 &#39;How many of our species survived?&#39;,
 &#34;It wasn&#39;t? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only &#34;
 &#39;three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!&#39;,
 &#39; Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, check it out! It&#39;s EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour &#39;11 for XBox. &#34;,
 &#34;Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I&#39;m gonna crash I&#39;m gonna &#34;
 &#39;crash! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh dude, was that a combo move?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, here come the cops! We&#39;ve gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.&#39;,
 &#39;I told you this game was sweet, dude.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How&#39;d you do that?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, you&#39;re going down, Elin!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When&#39;d you get that power-up?&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, you found another girl&#39;s phone number on my cell phone??&#34;,
 &#34;What the hell?! This game&#39;s all boring now!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!&#39;,
 &#39;Aww, books? I hate those!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh really? Sweet.&#39;,
 &#34;Oho man, I can&#39;t wait!&#34;,
 &#34;No on, come on, let&#39;s read it now!&#34;,
 &#34;Who, you&#39;re telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy &#34;
 &#39;shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!&#39;,
 &#39;Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept &#39;
 &#39;thinking, &#34;alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,&#34; and &#39;
 &#39;then after like a hundred pages I was like &#34;alright, I guess all the dirty &#39;
 &#39;stuff is at the end,&#34; and then I got to the last page, and I was all &#34;the &#39;
 &#39;fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;They fucking tricked us, that&#39;s what they did! Tricked us into reading a &#34;
 &#39;book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! &#39;,
 &#39;We know, we were just saying that.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not obscene, dude! I&#39;ll show them fucking obscene!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.&#39;,
 &#39;The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.&#39;,
 &#39;It was a... a warm spring morning. &#39;,
 &#34;Hehehhh, you&#39;re dead, Kenny!&#34;,
 &#34;...so why are we all fucked? They&#39;ll think you wrote it all.&#34;,
 &#34;And if I&#39;m going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, what are you up to?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan&#39;s mom found it.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#34;Butters, what the fuck do you think you&#39;re doing?!&#34;,
 &#34;Butters doesn&#39;t deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all &#34;
 &#39;the credit!&#39;,
 &#39;That inconsiderate jerk!&#39;,
 &#39;There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!&#39;,
 &#34;There is no point! It&#39;s just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin&#39; ugly!&#34;,
 &#34;All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We&#39;ve got to kill Sarah &#34;
 &#39;Jessica Parker.&#39;,
 &#34;Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book &#39;
 &#39;will get banned.&#39;,
 &#34;Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don&#39;t have to kill her, we can just help her &#34;
 &#39;get killed.&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at &#39;
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39; Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. &#39;,
 &#39;See any hunters yet?&#39;,
 &#39;Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.&#39;,
 &#39;So what?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh dude, sweet! &#39;,
 &#34;People are gonna want Butters&#39; head on a platter!&#34;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh come on!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.&#34;,
 &#39; You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose &#39;
 &#39;suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.&#39;,
 &#34;Yep, sorry. You&#39;re gonna have to come down and admit it was you. &#34;,
 &#34; Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#39;such a belly ache.&#39;,
 &#39; I know, it sucks. &#39;,
 &#39; KFC!! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh boy oh boy! I&#39;m gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!&#34;,
 &#34;Shut up you shifty Jew! I&#39;ll fuckin&#39; kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you &#34;
 &#34;know, when I&#39;ve been waiting too long for the Colonel&#39;s chicken I get easily &#34;
 &#34;agitated. You&#39;re a fuckin&#39; asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we &#34;

 &#39;Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!&#39;,
 &#34;They can&#39;t do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!&#34;,
 &#34;This is a ngihtmare. This is a ngihtmare and I CAN&#39;T WAKE UP!.&#34;,
 &#39;Mom, drive faster!&#39;,
 &#34;Shut up and drive faster! I&#39;ve been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!&#34;,
 &#34;WHAT?? Church&#39;s Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!&#34;,
 &#39;Fuck you!&#39;,
 &#34;No! No, what&#39;s going on?!  Move aside! &#34;,
 &#34;No you, you can&#39;t do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!&#34;,
 &#39;You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!&#39;,
 &#39;Nooooooooo-! &#39;,
 &#34; I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven&#39;t... &#34;
 &#39;had... KFC... in over... a week. &#39;,

 &#34;Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that&#39;s KFC gravy!  You have KFC! &#34;
 &#39;Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!&#39;,
 &#39;Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken &#39;
 &#39;skins!&#39;,
 &#34; NO!  Oh God, oh God it&#39;s so good.&#34;,

 &#39;Extra crispy? &#39;,

 &#34;You&#39;re cuttin&#39; Colonel&#39;s gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself &#34;
 &#34;some fuckin&#39; money!&#34;,
 &#39; Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!&#39;,
 &#34;Nothin&#39;, it&#39;s cool.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. &#39;,
 &#34;Good, &#39;cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. &#34;,
 &#39;Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?&#39;,
 &#34;Is that something I&#39;d want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world &#34;
 &#39;safe for pedophiles?&#39;,

 &#34;Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where&#39;s he go?&#34;,

 &#34;Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I&#39;m in charge now! Anybody got a &#34;

 &#39;Colonel, how are you doing?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? &#39;,
 &#39;We had a little problem.&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah? How&#39;d, how&#39;d you hear that?&#34;,
 &#34;Ey that&#39;s okay, we&#39;ll get him next time.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, take it easy Colonel.&#39;,
 &#34; Ey! Ey who the fuck do you think you&#39;re talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve got more friends than Ky-yle! I&#39;ve got more friends than Ky-yle!&#34;,
 &#34;&#39;Cause people think I&#39;m cool, dude.&#34;,
 &#39; Stupid Facebok stuff.&#39;,
 &#34;Stan, we know it&#39;s hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for &#34;
 &#39;you.&#39;,
 &#39;Surprise! &#39;,
 &#34;Alright, fine dude, you don&#39;t have to add any friends. You can just be like &#34;
 &#39;Kip Drordy&#39;,
 &#34;Kip Drordy, the third grader? He&#39;s got nooo Facebook friends.  And he&#39;s had &#34;
 &#39;a profile for more than six months.&#39;,
 &#34; Welcome to Cartman&#39;s Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today &#39;
 &#34;we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he&#39;s down to just &#34;
 &#39;11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your &#39;
 &#34;friend list because he is poison and I don&#39;t see him making a comeback any &#34;
 &#34;time soon.  You&#39;re gonna want t o dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde &#34;
 &#34;Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That&#39;s right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and &#34;
 &#34;his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don&#39;t have Clyde as a &#34;
 &#34;friend, you&#39;re gonna want to add him, because Clyde&#39;s numbers are about to &#34;
 &#39;go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more &#39;
 &#34;than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That&#39;s right. &#34;
 &#34;Looks like we&#39;re about to have a merger  So if you&#39;re a friend of Jimmy&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick &#34;
 &#34;friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That&#39;s all the time I &#34;
 &#39;have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip &#34;
 &#39;Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a &#39;
 &#39;liability. You gotta dump him.&#39;,
 &#39;Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try &#39;
 &#34;to make friends with people who&#39;ve never heard of Kip.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?&#34;,
 &#39;Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set &#39;

 &#39;Heeey, that is Tom Cruise. &#39;,
 &#39;Excuse me!  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?&#39;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t come for myself. I&#39;m just an escort for another celebrity who wants &#34;
 &#39;to get in on your lawsuit.&#39;,
 &#34;Wait, you mean, we aren&#39;t gonna sue and get a bunch of money?&#34;,
 &#34;Uh, &#39;scuse us for a second.  Alright, just what the hell do you think you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;doing?!&#39;,
 &#39;Cut the crap! I thought we were here for lawsuit money!&#39;,
 &#34;If we&#39;re staying here, then I wanna know what&#39;s going on! Don&#39;t forget, I &#34;
 &#39;know who you really are.  Mitch Connor!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re a no-good swindler and a two-bit thief! We were here for money, not &#34;
 &#39;goo!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, so what?&#39;,
 &#39;So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we steal it for ourselves.&#39;,
 &#39;No! No more tacos, Ms. Lopez!&#39;,
 &#39;You just had seven tacos!&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m sorry.  Why are you doing this?&#34;,
 &#34;You know goddamned well you&#39;re not really Jennifer Lopez! Now stop pissing &#34;
 &#39;me off!&#39;,
 &#34;Aww gee, they don&#39;t even make enchiritos anymore!&#34;,
 &#39;No, I tried getting one last week!&#39;,
 &#39;Gah, will somebody shut her up?!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m through with your stupid plans, Connor! I&#39;ve got better things to do &#34;
 &#39;with my time!&#39;,
 &#39;Let me by.&#39;,
 &#39;Screw this Connor! Find yourself another partner!&#39;,
 &#39;My father?&#39;,
 &#39;I know enough. My mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.&#39;,
 &#39;How would you know anything about who my family is?&#39;,
 &#34;If you&#39;re making this up to keep me around, Connor, then you&#39;d better-&#34;,
 &#39;Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room? When you told me my mother &#39;
 &#39;was my father.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t trust you! I wanna talk to Mr. Hat!&#34;,
 &#39;I said, Get! Mr.! Hat!&#39;,
 &#39;Put it on!  Do the voice!&#39;,
 &#39;Keep! Your hand! Up!&#39;,
 &#39;By who?! Goddamnit Garrison, who is my father?!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right! Tell me the truth! NOW!&#34;,
 &#39;&lt;&gt; Ahaaa!&#39;,
 &#39;Nice work, Connor.&#39;,
 &#39;Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!&#39;,
 &#39;Them who?!&#39;,
 &#39;Then start explaining it to me!&#39;,
 &#34;No nooo no no no! He&#39;s not doing anything except explaining who my father &#34;
 &#39;is!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all that matters!&#34;,
 &#39;I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!&#39;,
 &#39;Who you calling stupid, Jew?&#39;,
 &#39;Gingers? No!&#39;,
 &#39;Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?&#39;,
 &#39;Shut up, Connor! How about I shove thsi flashlight in your mouth?&#39;,
 &#34;Hello? I&#39;m here, whoever you are. &#34;,
 &#39;Daddy?&#39;,
 &#34; Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can&#39;t be.&#34;,
 &#39;Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you know?!&#39;,
 &#39;Mom?&#39;,
 &#39;Protect who??&#39;,
 &#39;My dad was a Denver Bronco?&#39;,
 &#39;No- nooo.&#39;,
 &#39;No! Noooo!&#39;,
 &#34;Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman&#39;s dad. Don&#39;t you guys realize what &#34;
 &#39;that means?&#39;,
 &#39;My dad was a ginger!&#39;,
 &#39;I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of &#39;
 &#39;me!&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Cheer up? I&#39;m half ginger.&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, you&#39;re right. That does make me pretty cool.&#34;,
 &#34;Really Mitch? Ya, you&#39;ve gotta go?&#34;,
 &#39;Take it easy, Connor. &#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do &#39;
 &#39;anythng for money, and I-.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have &#34;
 &#39;been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of &#39;
 &#39;beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m being serious, Kyle! Hello?!&#34;,
 &#39; You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia &#39;
 &#39;have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  &#39;
 &#39;Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to &#39;
 &#39;manipulate our minds today?&#39;,
 &#34;If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I&#39;ve presented &#34;
 &#39;enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species &#39;
 &#39;to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of &#39;
 &#39;our freedom. &#39;,
 &#39; Nothing. Just leave ma alone, okay?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just eh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! &#34;,
 &#39;Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be!, &#39;
 &#39;Stan&#39;,
 &#39; No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, &#39;
 &#34;those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it&#39;s soo cool! &#34;,
 &#39; Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me! Do you &#39;
 &#39;really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR &#39;
 &#39;driver? &#39;,
 &#34;No I can&#39;t; I&#39;ll always be like this. &#34;,
 &#39;Come on guys, I have to face facts. MASCAR is only for poor and stupid &#39;
 &#34;people. I don&#39;t have what it takes! &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh really? Hey, hey KENNY!&#39;,
 &#39;You love NASCAR huh?&#39;,
 &#34;Yyou see I told you guys!  What&#39;s the use? It just, it&#39;s hopeless! &#34;,
 &#34; I know you&#39;re trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has &#34;
 &#39;no place on a racetrack. &#39;,
 &#34;Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I&#39;d still be too rich.&#34;,
 &#34; You guys really think I could do this, don&#39;t you? You really belieave in &#34;
 &#39;me. &#39;,
 &#34;Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I&#39;m gonna go &#34;
 &#39;chase a dream. &#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, the guys have been talkin&#39; to me and well, they&#39;ve got me pretty &#34;
 &#34;pumped up.  I&#39;m psyched, Butters. I&#39;m about to do somethin&#39; big and  I&#39;m &#34;

 &#34;I know, I&#39;m not poor an&#39; stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I &#34;
 &#39;want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifrty-eight &#39;
 &#39;dollars and thirty-two cents.&#39;,
 &#34; Just get rid of it Butters! Don&#39;t tell me where you spend it and don&#39;t ever &#34;
 &#39;let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34; I told you I&#39;m serious, Butters.  Thisis my shot. I&#39;m gonna get as poor an&#39; &#34;
 &#39;stupid as I possibly can.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?&#39;,
 &#34;I need to get stupis, Butters. I&#39;m getting all the blood to rush to my head &#34;
 &#34;and watchin&#39; a marathon of Two And A Half Men.&#34;,
 &#39;Not yet.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw Goddamnit, another Vagisil commercial?!&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck, gross!&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  &#34;In some cases Vagisil can &#39;
 &#39;lead to short-term memory loss.&#34;  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of &#39;
 &#34;&#39;em, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m totally poor Butters. Did you forget?&#34;,
 &#34;Goddamnit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I&#39;ll try it here.  &#34;
 &#34;Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn&#39;t see me.&#34;,
 &#39;Is anybody coming?&#39;,
 &#34;Mm, &#39;kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it&#39;s... &#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, YES! I&#39;m feeling totally stupid right now.&#34;,
 &#34;Grab what you can and let&#39;s get out of here. I&#39;m ready!&#34;,
 &#39; Sweeet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Butters, I&#39;m totally poor and stupid. I&#39;m ready for NASCAR.&#34;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go NASCAR!  I&#39;m not moving, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh okay.  Let&#39;s go NASCAR! &#34;,
 &#39;Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, fuck my ass! &#39;,
 &#34;All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn&#39;t poor and stupid &#34;
 &#39;enough to win.&#39;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t you get it Butters?! It&#39;s never gonna happen for me! Those people are &#34;
 &#34;way more poor and stupid than I&#39;ll ever be. I might as well kill myself.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell &#34;
 &#34;I have! But it still wasn&#39;t enough.&#34;,
 &#34;Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don&#39;t wanna live like this.&#34;,
 &#39;Aw donkey balls...&#39;,
 &#34;Thanks, doc, but you aren&#39;t gonna make me feel any better.&#34;,
 &#34;Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn&#39;t poor enough?&#34;,
 &#34;Get me my coat, Butters. We&#39;re gonna try this thing again. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh hey, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Cone in dude, I wanna show you what I&#39;ve been workin&#39; on.  Check it out. I &#34;
 &#39;thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, &#39;
 &#39;but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no &#34;
 &#34;payments for two years! That&#39;s how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s it, right? &#34;,
 &#34;Kenny, I&#39;m just trying to get good at NASCAR.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh it&#39;s sooo easy for you, isn&#39;t it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my &#34;
 &#34;own, you know?! I wasn&#39;t born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! &#34;
 &#34;I didn&#39;t have parents to do it for me like you do! Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. &#34;
 &#34;We shouldn&#39;t be fighting. We both love Nascar and we&#39;re both poor shits.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah?&#39;,
 &#39;...Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#39;Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!&#39;,

 &#39;What the hell are you gous doing?!&#39;,
 &#34; And we&#39;re just gonna let him stand around here?! He&#39;s one of them; he could &#34;
 &#39;even be a spy!&#39;,
 &#34;Overcompensating a little, aren&#39;t we Kyle?!&#34;,
 &#34;Your blood is tainted with the three J&#39;s! Jewish, Jersey and Jinger! Admit &#34;
 &#39;it!&#39;,
 &#39;That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my &#39;
 &#39;head hit the treeeee. There was, there was there was bark and it scratched &#39;
 &#39;iiit.  Did you see the scratch, Kenny??&#39;,
 &#39;So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And &#39;
 &#39;then he screams, &#34;I\&#39;ll smash your teath in!&#34; My head is all like gashed &#39;
 &#39;open.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m telling you guys, he&#39;s getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. &#34;

 &#39;Come on you guys, hurry!&#39;,
 &#34;I told you guys, you&#39;re not gonna believe it. It&#39;s a miracle!&#34;,
 &#34; Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It&#39;s so keeewl.  It&#39;s right there in &#34;

 &#34;Dude, go see why. It&#39;s a Jesus miracle!&#34;,
 &#39;Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.&#39;,
 &#34;Trap you? No no Kyle, it&#39;s actually - lights!  Haha, it&#39;s a trap, Kyle! Get &#34;
 &#39;him to the meat locker! &#39;,
 &#39; Back away guys, this is for the safety of all of us. /i&gt; Sorry Kyle, but &#39;
 &#34;you can&#39;t be trusted.&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!&#39;,
 &#34;You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don&#39;t work on me!&#34;,
 &#39; Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?&#39;,
 &#39;What does it want?!&#39;,
 &#34;Nooo! You guys, it&#39;s raping me! It&#39;s raping me!!&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down &#39;
 &#34;inside, you&#39;re a monster. But you&#39;re my little monster.&#34;,
 &#39;So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in &#39;
 &#34;the other guy&#39;s mouth. &#34;,
 &#39; Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says &#34;We need to talk&#34; you might as well just start &#39;
 &#39;punching yourself in the balls, dude.&#39;,
 &#39; ...What?&#39;,

 &#34; Fine! You&#39;ll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon&#39;s lawyer, sir! &#34;,
 &#39;Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, &#39;
 &#39;Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. &#39;,

 &#34;ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don&#39;t you?!&#34;,
 &#34;Give up, you wanker! You fucking can&#39;t cook for shit!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh my God, isn&#39;t it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;your iPad? Oh right, you&#39;re not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, &#34;
 &#34;Token? Funny, you don&#39;t seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  &#34;
 &#34;Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square &#39;cause you don&#39;t have iPads!  &#34;
 &#34;Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I&#39;ll email some of my friends. &#34;
 &#34;Oh no, wait! Maybe I&#39;ll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! &#34;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Tom Solsman&#39;s dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! &#34;,
 &#34;Seriously you guys! Tom Solsman&#39;s dad is a drunk driver. He&#39;s the one who &#34;
 &#34;rnan over Joey Potts&#39;s dog because Joey Potts doesn&#39;t know how to take care &#34;
 &#39;of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom!&#39;,
 &#39;No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!&#39;,
 &#34;I left my charger at home!  Fine! I&#39;m gonna go home and charge my iPad and &#34;
 &#39;bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! &#39;,
 &#39;Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!&#39;,
 &#39;YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed &#39;
 &#34;in everyone&#39;s faces today isn&#39;t real and tomorrow everyone&#39;s gonna call ME a &#34;
 &#39;liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna &#39;
 &#39;at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, wifi plus 3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t wait to see the look on Kyle&#39;s stupid face when he sees my iPad has &#34;
 &#39;more memory than his!&#39;,
 &#34;Well you don&#39;t expect me to get the wifi-only 16-gig version, do you?&#34;,
 &#39;Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!&#39;,
 &#39;Toshiba Handibook??&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is &#39;
 &#34;gonna think I&#39;m a poverty-stricken asshole!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh, I&#39;ve got a better idea! Why don&#39;t you go across the street and buy some &#34;
 &#34;condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you&#39;re gonna fuck me, Mom!&#34;,
 &#39;You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke &#39;
 &#39;after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go &#39;
 &#39;ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best &#39;
 &#39;Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!&#39;,
 &#39;But I told you I was sorry.&#39;,
 &#34;I wasn&#39;t trying to get you in trouble.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn&#39;t say it &#34;
 &#34;around other people. I&#39;m sorry Momma.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, now that doesn&#39;t really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go &#39;
 &#39;back and get the Toshiba Handibook?&#39;,
 &#34;Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? &#39;Cause I like to &#34;
 &#34;be wined and dined after I&#39;ve been FUCKED! &#34;,
 &#39;Yes! She fucks me so hard!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, Filipino hookers don&#39;t get fucked the way I do!&#34;,
 &#39;At Best Buy.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh huh.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes!&#39;,
 &#39;No!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh there she is! There&#39;s my mom right now! &#34;,
 &#39;Booooooo!&#39;,
 &#39;Sh does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me &#39;
 &#39;on my birthday...&#39;,
 &#34;You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. &#39;Cause I liked to be &#34;
 &#39;kissed before I get fucked!&#39;,
 &#39; An iPad??? &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it &#39;
 &#34;shits in Kyle&#39;s mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been &#34;
 &#39;invented!!&#39;,
 &#39;Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!&#39;,
 &#34;What?! Hey, that&#39;s mine!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing &#39;
 &#39;ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? &#34;
 &#34;&#39;Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be &#34;
 &#39;nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick &#39;
 &#39;next time you decide to FUCK me! &#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;,
 &#39;Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were &#39;
 &#39;pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!&#39;,
 &#39;Ugh, let me talk to them. &#39;,
 &#39;Hör zu. Dieses ganze Ding ist ein Fehler. &#39;,
 &#39;Die egal und dei Comedy Awarding thing.  Es war Kinder der Special &#39;
 &#39;Education. Sie macht uns wählen. &#39;,
 &#39;Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter &#39;
 &#39;Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. &#39;,
 &#39; Well, I tried.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39;He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on &#34;Nurse Jackie&#34; and on &#34;Rockin\&#39; &#39;
 &#39;The Boat.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won&#39;t go away!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh wow, it&#39;s Adam Sandler.&#34;,
 &#39;Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s kind of funny, you guys.&#34;,
 &#34; Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He&#39;s got some sort of defense mechanism.&#34;,
 &#39;Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the &#39;
 &#39;world?&#39;,
 &#39;Paradox...&#39;,
 &#39; Or will there be?&#39;,
 &#39;My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.&#39;,
 &#39; Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking &#39;
 &#39;straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!&#39;,
 &#39; I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid &#39;
 &#39;principal have gone to far this time!!&#39;,
 &#34;No, I didn&#39;t do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of &#34;
 &#34;SNAKES! You&#39;re not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, you think I&#39;m overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school &#34;
 &#39;has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember &#39;
 &#39;the school physical we all took last week?!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the &#39;
 &#39;school hallway!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah they fucking did Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;Because they don&#39;t fucking care! I&#39;ve told you this! They don&#39;t give a shit &#34;
 &#39;about the students, and they live to make us miserable!&#39;,
 &#39;Go look for yourselves!!&#39;,
 &#39;There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: &#34;Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches&#34;!  &#39;
 &#39;Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! &#39;
 &#34;But don&#39;t put me on blast!&#34;,
 &#34;No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn&#39;t 1.4 inches either! It ISN&#39;T! This is &#34;
 &#39;another conspiracy by the school faculty!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated &#34;
 &#39;up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be &#39;
 &#39;dealt with!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, there&#39;s something we can do about it alright! If they&#39;re gonna put us on &#34;
 &#34;blast, they&#39;re at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to &#34;
 &#39;remeasure!!&#39;,
 &#34; Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That&#39;s .2 inches &#34;
 &#39;more than what the school said.&#39;,
 &#39;Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. &#39;,
 &#34;Alright Butters, let&#39;s see what you got going down there.&#34;,
 &#34;Butters, I don&#39;t have time fot this! I can&#39;t wait if your wiener is pulling &#34;
 &#39;a Scared Turtle.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, &#39;
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, that&#39;s everybody. Let&#39;s go post these numbers.  What?&#34;,
 &#39;What, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34;I measured mine this morning. See? It&#39;s right here at the top. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty good.&#34;,
 &#39;Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis &#39;
 &#39;yourselves?! Are you homos?!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! &#39;,
 &#34;There, you see? My wiener isn&#39;t 1.2 inches, it&#39;s 1.4!  What, Red?! You&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys&#39;?! I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;care!  Clearly I&#39;m very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would &#34;
 &#39;I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at &#39;
 &#34;all?! Don&#39;t forget that this was all my idea!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, Goddamnit!&#39;,
 &#34;Let me guess: I&#39;m in trouble again!&#34;,
 &#39;For what?!&#39;,
 &#39;Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school &#39;
 &#39;bulletin board?!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t care if Obama IS President! You don&#39;t go around putting little boys &#34;
 &#39;on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re damn right! One point two inches! I&#39;ll have you know that my penis is &#34;
 &#34;a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it&#39;s still the smallest in school, but it&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;.2 inches bogger than you said!!&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Those weren&#39;t our dick sizes?&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know! Why would you?!&#34;,
 &#34; Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;because of me?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh God. Why couldn&#39;t I have just taken a minute to think about it?&#34;,
 &#34;Fuck you! No I don&#39;t!&#34;,
 &#34;Honsetly, I wouldn&#39;t really care.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not fat! I&#39;m big-boned!&#34;,
 &#39;Why the fuck am I here?!&#39;,
 &#39;Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, that&#39;s cool.&#34;,
 &#39;My penis is 13 inches long.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah dude!&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Burn it down, dude! &#39;,
 &#39;The Jews!&#39;,
 &#39;No, and fuck Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, dude, they aren&#39;t gonna give us what we want!&#34;,
 &#39;Wait, what?&#39;,
 &#39;Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m still fucking angry!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh. Hey Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m volunteering.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;m volunteering my time, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. &#34;
 &#39;Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. &#39;,
 &#39;Ah, crap! &#39;,
 &#34;Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admint we aren&#39;t actually doing volunteer work &#34;
 &#39;at the hospital.&#39;,
 &#34;What if I were to tell you there&#39;s a way to help those poor babies born &#34;
 &#39;addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.&#39;,
 &#34;Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don&#39;t tell on us!  We could &#34;
 &#39;actually really use you!&#39;,
 &#39;Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Damnit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, &#39;
 &#39;hold on a second!&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack &#34;
 &#39;babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!&#39;,
 &#39;We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. &#39;,
 &#34;Ask the guys. There&#39;s six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do &#34;
 &#39;is pit the crack babies against each other with a liiittle ball of crack.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn&#39;t hurt the crack babies at all. We&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny&#39;s. It&#39;s Baconalia time.&#34;,
 &#39;After you. &#39;,
 &#39;Come on. &#39;,
 &#39;We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet &#39;
 &#34;stuff. We&#39;ve built up to a thousand hits a day.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a good life, Kyle. We&#39;ve come here every night for Denny&#39;s Baconalia &#34;
 &#39;specials.&#39;,
 &#39;Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a &#39;
 &#39;bacon sundae for dessert.&#39;,
 &#34;We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We&#39;re getting Slash &#34;
 &#39;to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred &#39;
 &#39;thousand for the video game rights.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best &#34;
 &#34;of all, it&#39;s all charity, so it&#39;s tax free. &#34;,
 &#39;Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up &#39;
 &#39;at you.&#39;,
 &#34;Somebody&#39;s gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to &#34;
 &#39;the firm. &#39;,
 &#39;Betsy MacIntosh?&#39;,
 &#34;We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;skipped out on your rehab once again?&#39;,
 &#34;We need to speak with you, ma&#39;am. &#34;,
 &#39;And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still &#39;
 &#39;addicted to cocaine?&#39;,
 &#34; Well ma&#39;am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play &#34;
 &#39;for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. &#39;,
 &#34;We believe that St. Mary&#39;s is the best hospital for your child, and we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male &#39;
 &#34;or female, or so deforemd you&#39;ll never be able to tell?&#34;,
 &#34; Just sign the paper and he&#39;ll be playing ball for St. Mary&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, nothing. Crack baby players can&#39;t make a salary, based on the rules.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t make the rules, ma&#39;am, I just think them up and write them down. &#34;
 &#34;Now, if you&#39;ll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on &#34;
 &#39;the-&#39;,
 &#34;Rgh! Ma&#39;am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It &#34;
 &#39;was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly &#39;
 &#39;states &#34;benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being.&#34; I &#39;
 &#39;cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little &#39;
 &#39;bit of crack. Butters? &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this &#34;
 &#39;up?!  All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the &#39;
 &#39;matchup between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!&#39;,
 &#34; Slash is not hard to find! He&#39;ll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! &#34;
 &#34;He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ&#39;s sake! Look! Look! He&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, &#39;
 &#39;the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are &#39;
 &#34;you? Yes sir, we&#39;re very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we &#34;
 &#39;know the videogame version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  &#39;
 &#39;Hey Kyle. Have a seat.&#39;,
 &#39;Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is &#39;
 &#34;Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How&#39;s it goin&#39;, man?&#34;,
 &#34;They can&#39;t make money. It&#39;s against the rules.&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive &#39;
 &#39;compensation of any kind for their playing.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my &#39;
 &#39;safety to get up there and change the rules?!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re a non-profit company, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#39;Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. &#34;,
 &#39;Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.&#39;,
 &#39;A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in &#39;
 &#39;your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this compnay, we owe it not only to &#39;
 &#39;ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as &#39;
 &#34;possible. McDonald&#39;s french fries and KFC gravy. The French call this &#34;
 &#39;&#34;poutaine.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I&#39;ll do some undercover work and find &#34;
 &#39;out how the other companies get away with it.&#39;,
 &#34; Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I&#39;m a well-respected owner in the &#34;
 &#39;slave trade.&#39;,
 &#39;My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got &#39;
 &#34;yourself a luuucrative bidness, don&#39;t ye. Well let me get right down to it &#34;
 &#39;theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I &#39;
 &#34;find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin&#39; if you &#34;
 &#39;could share some secrets.&#39;,
 &#34; You have some might strong-lookin&#39; workers heah, sahr. I&#39;d be willin&#39; to &#34;
 &#39;offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.&#39;,
 &#39;Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their &#39;
 &#34;likeness for video games, how do we get around payin&#39; for our slaves uh- &#34;
 &#39;&#34;student atheletes&#34; then?&#39;,
 &#34;I ain&#39;t arguin&#39;. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, &#34;
 &#39;right?&#39;,
 &#34;But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any &#39;
 &#34;government agency listenin&#39; in on this heah conversation, they should know &#34;
 &#34;that we&#39;er not talkin&#39; &#39;bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how &#34;
 &#39;do you get around not paying your slaves.&#39;,
 &#34;You think you can do whatever you want &#39;cause your corporation is a &#34;
 &#39;university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation &#39;
 &#34;couldn&#39;t hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw &#34;
 &#34;you sahr, I&#39;m goin&#39; home! &#34;,
 &#34;How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he&#39;s playing at the &#34;
 &#39;mall and you offer him a deal!&#39;,
 &#39;How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!&#39;,
 &#39;Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the &#39;
 &#34;post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you&#39;ll have &#34;
 &#34;Slash&#39;s home address!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah it&#39;s a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are &#34;
 &#39;we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!&#39;,
 &#39;...What?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God... It&#39;s genius, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#39;This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, &#39;
 &#34;but we buy ourselves a million dollars&#39; worth of goodwill with the public. &#34;
 &#39;We can say we gave our &#34;student athletes&#34; a place to live and grow for a few &#39;
 &#34;years. It&#39;s like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! &#34;
 &#39;Great work! &#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Vunter Slash?&#39;,
 &#39;But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?&#39;,
 &#34;But then, who was the guitar player for Guns &#39;N Roses?&#34;,
 &#39;Are you fucking serious? &#39;,
 &#39;You knew about this??&#39;,
 &#34;I just can&#39;t believe Slash isn&#39;t real,&#34;,
 &#39;I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was &#39;
 &#39;told Slash would come and play for me.&#39;,
 &#39; He is real, you guys. &#39;,
 &#39;Alright now, open presents! Open presents!&#39;,
 &#34;Where&#39;s mine? Where&#39;s mine where&#39;s mine where&#39;s mine?&#34;,

 &#39;Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s lying, dude. Hit X&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Looke like ice cream to me.&#39;,

 &#39;Oh cool, the movie trailers!&#39;,
 &#39;That looks pretty good.&#39;,
 &#39;Stan, knock it off!&#39;,
 &#34;No, Kyle&#39;s right. You suck, dude.&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, we don&#39;t wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get &#39;
 &#34;shots again!  But this time it&#39;s so that we don&#39;t get warts in our vaginas!&#34;,
 &#39;Yep!&#39;,
 &#34;They why are they sayin&#39; that gettin&#39; vaccinated at school is gonna make us &#34;
 &#39;all retarded.&#39;,
 &#39;Wait what?&#39;,
 &#34;Wait, there&#39;s a disease called Assburgers?&#34;,
 &#34;You are so lying! There&#39;s no disease called fuckin&#39; Assburgers!&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, you&#39;re on, Jew! &#34;,
 &#34;Did you guys know there&#39;s actually a disease called Assburgers? &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, it&#39;s a butt fungus.&#34;,
 &#39;Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy &#39;
 &#39;glow-&#39;,
 &#34; Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don&#39;t konw what&#39;s wrong with me.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, that&#39;s a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! &#34;
 &#34;There&#39;s a sharp pain in my buns!&#34;,
 &#34;I-I&#39;ll try. I&#39;ll try. &#34;,
 &#39;A what??&#39;,
 &#34;Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You&#39;re saying I have &#34;
 &#39;assburgers??&#39;,
 &#39;What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now &#39;
 &#39;clearly I have Assburgers!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;m glad you think assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your &#34;
 &#39;records there!&#39;,
 &#39; Goodamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!&#39;,
 &#34; I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That&#39;s what&#39;s the &#34;
 &#39;matter!&#39;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#39;Gee, thanks Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.&#39;,
 &#39;There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.&#39;,
 &#39;How are we doing on those patties, Jew?&#39;,
 &#39;Nice!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all right. I think another batch is just finishing off in our &#34;
 &#39;top-secret flavor enhancer.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our &#34;
 &#34;patented flavor will be everywhere, and we&#39;ll have to go back to school. Now &#34;
 &#39;let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! &#39;,
 &#39;Everything alright here, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll take these to the flavor enhancer.&#34;,
 &#39;The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! &#39;,

 &#39;single one! Yeehaw!&#39;,
 &#34; Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We&#39;ve got a Mexican! &#34;,

 &#39;uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...&#39;,
 &#34;YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You&#39;re never gonna guess what!  Seriously &#34;
 &#39;you guys, guuess what??&#39;,
 &#34;You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart&#39;s class?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!&#39;,
 &#39;He crapped his pants toduay during social studies! He had to go to the &#39;
 &#34;nurse&#39;s office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! &#34;,
 &#34;Because, dude, it&#39;s all over Eavesdropper!&#34;,
 &#34;Puhah! You guys don&#39;t follow Eavesdropper?  It&#39;s a Web site about all the &#34;
 &#39;students in the school! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah, I&#39;m showin&#39; the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of &#34;
 &#34;the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman&#39;s mom.  Just listen, listen &#34;
 &#39;listen.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah, we&#39;re listenin&#39; to it! &#34;,
 &#39;Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Poopypants Pete&#34;, but th- but then I also thought of &#34;Mushpants Melman.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Oh Jesus, what now?! &#39;,
 &#34;Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin&#39; funny! &#34;,
 &#34;Tchehe, right. That&#39;s why it&#39;s superfunny to me.&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah, he killed himself.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey! Whoooa&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Kay, whoa, whoa! We&#39;ve been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;death on me! I&#39;m not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have &#34;
 &#39;to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to &#39;
 &#39;just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!&#39;,
 &#34;Do you really think information like this will just die down? There&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;Internet! There&#39;s Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna &#34;
 &#39;kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.&#39;,
 &#34; Heh! You&#39;re crazy! It can&#39;t be done!&#34;,
 &#34;You aren&#39;t listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?&#34;,
 &#39;Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?&#39;,
 &#39;Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;So... whatcha doin&#39; for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even &#34;
 &#39;baked cupcakes. &#39;,
 &#34;I was just thinkin&#39; that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;always kind of...  liked you.&#39;,
 &#34;I know. Ah I know you don&#39;t like me back. I juh... Yeah, you know, the- this &#34;
 &#34;was stupid, I&#39;m sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don&#39;t take the &#34;
 &#34;cupc- I, I&#39;m sorry. I, I&#39;m sorry I wasted your time. &#34;,
 &#39; You okay, Jenny?&#39;,
 &#39;Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. &#39;,
 &#34;Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let &#34;
 &#39;us get up and leave during the class.&#39;,
 &#39;Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God! Jinny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It&#39;s WAY &#34;
 &#39;worse than Pete Melman was! &#39;,
 &#39;WAY worse!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, kewl.&#39;,
 &#34;You said Pete Melman couldn&#39;t kill himself! By making Jenny Simons crap her &#34;
 &#34;pants worse than Pete, I&#39;ve made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! &#34;,
 &#39;Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those &#39;
 &#39;tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the &#39;
 &#34;tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you&#39;re serving &#34;
 &#34;the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we&#39;re going to put laxatives and &#34;
 &#34;Arby&#39;s horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their &#34;
 &#34;pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody&#39;s singled out, &#34;
 &#39;problem solved. &#39;,
 &#39;Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? &#39;,
 &#34;Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby&#39;s horsey sauce on &#34;
 &#39;there, mhm.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I think they&#39;re all ready.&#34;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone &#34;
 &#39;forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my &#39;
 &#34;payment?!  I&#39;m not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I &#34;
 &#39;wanted, now!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! &#39;,
 &#39;No thanks. Okay, proceed.&#39;,
 &#39;That. Was. Amazing.&#39;,
 &#39;Boy, I say.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay Mr. Mackey. I&#39;m totally over it.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, you&#39;re most certainly welcome.&#34;,
 &#39;Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?&#39;,
 &#34; I put a lot of Arby&#39;s horsey sauace on those.&#34;,
 &#34;Coach! Feegan the vegan won&#39;t jump off the board! Hey Coach!&#34;,
 &#34;Well let&#39;s just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive &#34;
 &#39;attitude about it. &#39;,
 &#34;Heheh! Look at Kenny. He&#39;s so poor, huh you guys? His family&#39;s so poor they &#34;
 &#34;couldn&#39;t pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. &#34;,
 &#39;Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew &#39;
 &#39;on a rope?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That&#39;s about all of &#34;
 &#39;us.&#39;,
 &#34;Wow, Craig. I can&#39;t believe you just went there. Here we were having a &#34;
 &#39;perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and &#39;
 &#39;you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God! Why doesn&#39;t everyone just back off?! I know how this works: &#34;
 &#34;You&#39;re the 99% ganging up on the 1%!&#34;,
 &#39;Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!&#39;,
 &#39;Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% &#39;
 &#39;and that made me not keeeewl.&#39;,
 &#39;I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you mean, Peter Panda?&#39;,
 &#34;Thanks Polly Prissy Pants. I&#39;m just so scared that all the kids at school &#34;
 &#34;are gonna be talkin&#39; about me behind my back.&#34;,
 &#39;What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys &#39;
 &#34;doin&#39;-What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% &#34;
 &#34;rally, aren&#39;t you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys &#34;
 &#34;are all here protesting?! Because you&#39;re pissed off, but you actually think &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you&#39;re all just pissed &#34;
 &#39;off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick &#39;
 &#39;it to the 1%! See what it gets you! &#39;,
 &#39;Non, have you been here all day?!&#39;,
 &#34;Somebody&#39;s been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!&#34;,
 &#39;Am I sure?? Look at this place!&#39;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks &#34;
 &#34;they have to blame ME!  They didn&#39;t take my Stormtroper watch...  My Arkham &#34;
 &#39;City game is still here... what else could they have-  Oh my God.  Clyde &#39;
 &#39;Frog!&#39;,
 &#39;No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! &#39;,
 &#39; Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a &#34;
 &#39;visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said &#39;
 &#39;anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat &#39;
 &#34;there goin&#39; along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on &#34;
 &#39;you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to &#39;
 &#34;become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re sitting there right &#34;
 &#39;now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your &#39;
 &#39;hand thinking, &#34;I\&#39;m not getting away with this, am I?&#34; Because whoever you &#39;
 &#39;are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and &#39;
 &#39;tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you &#39;
 &#39;should just-&#39;,
 &#39;Got something to say Kyle?! &#39;,
 &#39;How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but &#39;
 &#34;uh but let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. There&#39;s still a biiig investigation &#34;
 &#39;to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, &#39;
 &#39;you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. &#39;,
 &#39;Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are &#39;
 &#39;finally gone to-&#39;,
 &#39;Fly bu-what?&#39;,
 &#39; Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog &#39;
 &#39;Foundation. Fly fly fly...&#39;,
 &#34;Oh fine, go on and leave! I&#39;m gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;gonna have your fuckin&#39; balls! Fly to Christ.&#34;,
 &#34;Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog&#39;s death is as &#34;
 &#39;shocking to all of you as it is to me.&#39;,
 &#34;I know that I&#39;m awesome and keewl, Polly Prissy Pants, but it has little &#34;
 &#34;erlevance at the moment to Clyde Frog&#39;s murder!&#34;,
 &#39;What do you mean, Rumper Tumpskin?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.&#34;,
 &#39;So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!&#39;,
 &#34; Don&#39;t you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t try to talk, Peter Panda! You&#39;re gonna be okay!&#34;,
 &#39; Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!&#39;,
 &#39;This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it &#39;
 &#34;too? Don&#39;t worry Polly Prissy Pants, you&#39;re gonna be safe here. In this day &#34;
 &#39;and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will &#39;
 &#39;be alright.&#39;,
 &#34;Token, please. You&#39;re the only person I can trust. Because in today&#39;s time, &#34;
 &#39;black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.&#39;,
 &#39;What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissy Pants?&#39;,
 &#34;Muh uh, &#39;cause I&#39;ll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.&#34;,
 &#34;Naw uh, &#39;cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for &#34;
 &#39;me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!&#39;,
 &#39;What?! Who?!&#39;,
 &#34;I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I&#39;ll be right back! &#34;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! &#34;,
 &#39;Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh sure!&#39;,
 &#39;Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, &#39;
 &#39;Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!&#39;,
 &#39;HAAAAGH! &#39;,
 &#34; I dno&#39;t trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! &#34;,
 &#34;Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven&#39;t you done enough to &#34;
 &#39;me?! &#39;,
 &#39;Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!!&#39;,
 &#39;Polly Prissy Pants! Rumper Tumpskin!  Jesus Christ! &#39;,
 &#39;Who did this to you?!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get you down!&#34;,
 &#39;AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! RUMPER TUMPSKIN!! RUMPER  Rumper Tumpskin... WHY? Why did &#39;
 &#39;you do this??&#39;,
 &#39;Polly... Polly Prissy Pants... You did this?&#39;,
 &#39;...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! &#39;,
 &#39;They were your FRIENDS!&#39;,
 &#34;Polly Prissy Pants, when people find out we did all this, we&#39;re gonna get in &#34;
 &#39;total trouble!&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. &#34;
 &#39;You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissy Pants. That nobody would possibly &#39;
 &#34;blame Token for all this because in today&#39;s day and age you can&#39;t blame a &#34;
 &#39;black person for anything.&#39;,
 &#34;Noho! I&#39;ve lost every stuffed animal; I won&#39;t lose you too!&#34;,
 &#39; Goodbye, Polly Prissy Pants. I love you.&#39;,
 &#39;Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? &#39;,
 &#39;This is buulcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report &#39;
 &#39;on Thanksgiving?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus Kyle, you are really being crumpy today.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving &#39;
 &#34;let&#39;s just go downstairs and watch TV.&#34;,
 &#34; Dumbass, it&#39;s November.  The History Channel is probably playing &#34;
 &#39;Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;got History Channel?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh-huh??&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, let&#39;s take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at &#34;
 &#39;Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? &#39;,
 &#39;Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop &#39;
 &#39;bringing everyone down? Kyle? &#39;,
 &#34;Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it&#39;s called menopause?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, God takes yoru period away, and apparently it makes you really &#39;
 &#34;irritable? I was thinking maybe that&#39;s why Kyle&#39;s been so grouchy lately, &#34;
 &#34;&#39;cause he&#39;s goin&#39; through menopause.&#34;,
 &#39;See what I mean, you guys? &#39;,
 &#39;Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?&#39;,
 &#34;Tell me you&#39;ve already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh no. Oh NO!&#39;,
 &#34;Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there&#39;s gonna be a massive &#34;
 &#34;stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We&#39;ve gotta go to the store! &#34;,
 &#39;You guys have stuffing?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh... We&#39;re not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!&#34;,

 &#34;Yeah. I&#39;ve gone through every student in the school, and I&#39;m pretty sure now &#34;
 &#34;that Kenny&#39;s gone, the poor kid is Craig!&#34;,
 &#34;Pretty much went through everybody. Craig&#39;s got the mo-  sh, sh shuh sh sh. &#34;

 &#39;everybody else does.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh come on! We&#39;re not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You &#34;
 &#34;think, you think Kyle isn&#39;t on the computer right now tryin&#39; to see who the &#34;
 &#39;poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that &#39;
 &#34;heartless Jew!  Well I won&#39;t give him the satisfaction!&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, let&#39;s hear it for Kyle!  He&#39;s so funny, isn&#39;t he guys?! With all &#34;
 &#34;his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman&#39;s mom &#34;
 &#34;is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;superfunny guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman&#39;s mom is so poor that when &#34;
 &#34;she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people&#39;s fingers! HA! I bear you to &#34;
 &#39;it, Keh-al!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s kewl! Whatever Keh-al! Must be nice having everything you want! &#34;,
 &#39; Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?!&#39;,
 &#39;You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I&#39;m now the poorest &#34;
 &#39;kids in skewl!&#39;,
 &#34; We&#39;re in a tough economy. You don&#39;t know what else I want you to do about &#34;
 &#34;it. Life isn&#39;t handed to you, Mom! You just can&#39;t sit on your ass and expect &#34;
 &#39;some money to appear!&#39;,
 &#39;Not much p-uh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she &#39;
 &#39;thought she was running out of food stamps!&#39;,
 &#34;IT&#39;S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! &#34;,
 &#39;My mom is so poor she waves around a popsicle and calls it air &#39;
 &#34;conditioniiing. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;familyyy.&#39;,
 &#39; What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you &#39;
 &#39;financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses &#39;
 &#34;Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I&#39;m off to a foster home then.  Hawaii &#34;
 &#39;is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a &#39;
 &#39;short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my &#39;
 &#34;mother&#39;s arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah yeah.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#39;Wha? Dude, do you think this is funny?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;ll tell you somethin&#39;! Being from a low-income household isn&#39;t funny! &#34;

 &#39;A joke?! you thnk being poor is a joke?!&#39;,

 &#34;lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he&#39;s the &#34;
 &#39;poorest kid at this school!&#39;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#34; YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We&#39;re good! I seriuosly thought we &#34;
 &#34;didn&#39;t stand a chance, but now... everything&#39;s gonna be okay! &#39;Cause I&#39;m not &#34;

 &#39;I was just teasing.&#39;,
 &#39;My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!&#39;,
 &#34;Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you&#39;re doing is taking topical &#34;
 &#39;and revamping old Catholic jokes!&#39;,
 &#39;Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not saying it.&#34;,

 &#34;Okay, fine!  I&#39;m white trash and I&#39;m in trouble!&#34;,
 &#34; There he is, there&#39;s my buddy.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there&#39;s an important &#34;
 &#34;lesson I think we&#39;ve all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned? &#34;
 &#34;The day&#39;s looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue. &#39;Cause I&#39;m not He&#39;s &#34;

 &#34;Now I&#39;m rich just like Stan and Kiul! All that matters is no one thinks I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;a tool! &#39;Cause I&#39;m not He&#39;s not, he&#39;s not That&#39;s right. The poor kid in &#34;
 &#34;school. Sing it with me, guys! He&#39;s not the poor kid in school. He&#39;s not I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;not- &#39;,
 &#39; Awwww my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if &#39;
 &#39;you ask her if she lost a shoe, she\&#39;d say &#34;No I found ooone.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; Oooo, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn&#39;t be able to put rules on toilet &#34;
 &#39;time like that. Toilet time is the last bastion of Aemrican freedom.&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Course man. It&#39;s cool.&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Clyde! Clyde! What have I told you about pissin\&#39; on the seat?!&#34; And &#39;
 &#39;Clyde\&#39;s all like, &#34;Ohhh, okay Mom! Fuck, not in front of my friends!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;I know, right? Women are just jealous because they have to face outwards to &#39;
 &#39;pee and crap.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m telling you, it was freakin&#39; hysterical. Clyde had to get up in &#34;
 &#39;the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the toilet seat down! He &#39;
 &#39;was so embarassed dude I thought he was gonna die!&#39;,
 &#39;And his mom, his mom goes, &#34;Clyde, you\&#39;re an asshole, and I got toilet &#39;
 &#39;water in my vaginjay!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;I know dude, the bathroom&#39;s the last bastion of American freedom.&#34;,
 &#39; Uh uh.&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, get the door! &#39;,
 &#39;Who are these buttholes?&#39;,
 &#34;My potty?  What are they gonna do to it??  Hey. Hey, that&#39;s my bathroom!&#34;,
 &#34;Dude you can&#39;t make me wear a seat belt to take a dump!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, but the blood&#39;s on Clyde&#39;s wiener, not mine!&#34;,
 &#34;Ugh. This is unbelievable! Stupid Toilet Safety Administration! You can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;even take a crap at IHOP without a 40-minute line!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey, how about you people speed it up in here! I&#39;m about to crap my pants, &#34;
 &#39;and I demand access to the toilet RIGHT NOW!&#39;,
 &#34;What?? Yes I mind! Do you mind if I touch your fuckin&#39; balls?! &#34;,
 &#39;Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped &#39;
 &#39;away one by one?! It\&#39;s time for us to stand together ans ay, &#34;We want the &#39;
 &#39;government out of our bathrooms!&#34;  Now listen! All we have to do is agree as &#39;
 &#34;a community to all bolt our toilet seats down! If it can&#39;t raise or lower &#34;
 &#39;there will be zero chance of anyone falling in!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, sorry women might have to deal with a little &#34;splash&#34; of pee on the &#39;
 &#34;rim, but it&#39;s a far better solution than having the government in our &#34;
 &#39;bathrooms, right?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, sorry, but if we don&#39;t want the government treating us like children, &#34;
 &#39;we might have to give up being able to pee our feces in half.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#39;Wait, what? What the fuck is a sueance?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh boy, here we go.&#39;,
 &#39;So then, so then Clyde\&#39;s mom\&#39;s ghost is all like, &#34;Clyde, what have I told &#39;
 &#39;you Clyde? Ya asshole!&#34;  And, and Clyde\&#39;s all like, &#34;Mom, leave me alone! &#39;
 &#39;I\&#39;m seriously, stop, please!&#34; Dude, it was a riot! &#39;,
 &#34;Hah, yeah well, I&#39;m just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;ve had a tough week Clyde, but, at least your mom didn&#39;t die for &#34;
 &#34;nothin&#39;. I mean, we&#39;re kind of right back to the bathroom being the last &#34;
 &#34;bastion of Aemrican freedom, so technically your mom did die for nothin&#39; &#34;
 &#39;but... Clyde? Clyde? Clyde, are you there? Hello? &#39;,

 &#39;Okay look! A lot of people &#34;claim&#34; that on Passover, a blood-sucking &#39;
 &#39;creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children.  This year, &#39;
 &#39;Passover happens to be the week as Easter.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just a legend, alright?!  But people all over town have started &#34;
 &#39;reporting strange things. Knocked-over trashcans, weird howls.&#39;,
 &#34; Yuh huh, Token! on&#39;t think it won&#39;t come after you just &#39;cause you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;black!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright alright stay back STAY BACK.  Definitely looks like a Jewpacabra &#39;
 &#34;attack, but it&#39;s hard to tell.&#34;,
 &#34;Alright guys, we&#39;re gonna need some video cameras. We&#39;ve gotta go out at &#34;
 &#39;night and get proof of this thing.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m trying to protect people! And why are you so quick to try and cover up &#34;
 &#34;Jewpacabra&#39;s existence?!&#34;,
 &#34;Well neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;spotted a Sasquatch!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Come on, Butters. You and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? &#39;
 &#39;ZEERO.&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t do this alone. Please, help me prove to the rest of the world &#34;
 &#39;Jewpacabra is real.&#39;,
 &#39;Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of &#39;
 &#39;forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.&#39;,
 &#39;Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re dealing wiht a &#34;
 &#39;creature that drinks blood, hides in the night, and has absolutely no belief &#39;
 &#34;in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I&#39;m gonna try a Jewpacabra &#34;
 &#34;mating call now.  NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I&#39;M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE &#34;
 &#34;CHRIST THING!  He&#39;s here somewhere.&#34;,
 &#39;JESUS IS A LIE!&#39;,
 &#39;Shhh. Help me call it out, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39; Buttes, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! THERE IS NO &#39;
 &#39;CHRIST!&#39;,
 &#39;No way Jesus was the Son of God, huh Butters?&#39;,
 &#39; Do you hear that?&#39;,
 &#34;I didn&#39;t think you would believe me. And that&#39;s why last night I took it &#34;
 &#34;upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I&#39;m about to &#34;
 &#34;show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. And you&#39;re the first &#34;
 &#39;to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes, &#39;
 &#34;then a strange animal-like scurrying sound. That&#39;s when we saw... this. &#39;K &#34;
 &#39;wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for ih-waitforitrightthere!  Did &#39;
 &#34;you see the Jewpacabra?! I know, it&#39;s so shocking it takes a minute for your &#34;
 &#34;brain to process what it&#39;s seeing. Watch again. Wait for it. Wait for &#34;
 &#34;it-there!  Jewpacabra.  There&#39;s a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.&#34;,
 &#34;It was no dog! I was there. I&#39;m telling you this thing had... nono idea &#34;
 &#39;Jesus Christ had died for our sins.&#39;,
 &#34;I could try to catch it, but I&#39;m gonna need all theh resources you&#39;ve got. &#34;
 &#34;If this thing isn&#39;t contained, your Easter egg hunt is going to be a &#34;
 &#39;bloodbath. &#39;,
 &#39;We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. There&#39;s a resort near there called The Atlantis Hotel and &#34;
 &#39;Casino. They have a waterslide there that goes through a shark tank.&#39;,
 &#34;Weeeeed!  Oh, that&#39;s cool!  Check it out! &#34;,
 &#39;Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the &#39;
 &#39;Jewpacabra into theh hands of professionals who can analyze it.&#39;,
 &#34;People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there! I&#39;ve &#34;
 &#34;explored the depths of Atlantis and now I&#39;m about to prove a new species &#34;
 &#34;exists! I&#39;m a little James Cameron.&#34;,
 &#39;These are professional people who go around tracking sasquatches, Kyle! They &#39;
 &#34;aren&#39;t liars and they aren&#39;t stupid!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve already done my research, boys. What you&#39;re looking at there... is a &#34;
 &#39;Jewpacabra. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s like a sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more &#34;
 &#39;greedy.&#39;,
 &#34;Well I guess that&#39;s it. You&#39;re gonna have to allow only me into the Easter &#34;
 &#34;egg hunt, sir. I&#39;m the only one qualified. &#34;,
 &#39;Heh...  what do you mean?&#39;,
 &#34;Well I mean, it could&#39;ve just been a dog.&#34;,
 &#34;Well come on boys, it&#39;s probably a Jewbacabra, but this isn&#39;t definitive.&#34;,
 &#39;Why?&#39;,
 &#34;No way. No way Jewpacabra&#39;s real. Those, those cryptozoologists don&#39;t know &#34;
 &#34;what they&#39;re talking about. They just, they just gave me a taste of the &#34;
 &#34;Hewbrew jeebies, that&#39;s all.  Hey, uh, Jewpacabras can&#39;t be real, right? &#34;
 &#34;Tell me again why it can&#39;t be real?  I mean, it&#39;s impossible that something &#34;
 &#39;I made up to turn out to actually exist, right, huh Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, okay! Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn&#39;t know I was the one &#34;
 &#34;who got video of it, huh? How can it know that? It couldn&#39;t know that, &#34;
 &#39;right? Kyle? &#39;,
 &#34; Jesus loves me, this I know, &#39;cause Republicans told me so. Little ones God &#34;
 &#34;will protect, &#39;cause letting kids be harmed is child ne...glect...  &#34;
 &#39;Everything still clear out there? Guys. &#39;,
 &#34;Well check everywhere! I&#39;m not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch &#34;
 &#39;your buttholes.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s trying to come in! Where the hell are you guys?!&#34;,
 &#39; Wing Street?!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I want wings!  WAAAH!  Oh Jesus, it&#39;s only you.&#34;,
 &#39;HUH?&#39;,
 &#39;Get me out of here! Please, some help!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh God it&#39;s gonna kill me!  What the?!&#34;,
 &#34; This isn&#39;t safe or fun!&#34;,
 &#34;No! Come back! come back please, this isn&#39;t right!&#34;,
 &#34; Kyle. Hey Kyle!  I know what you&#39;re thinking, Kyle. That like this is some &#34;
 &#39;kind of fitting comeuppance.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh of course. Uh I was lying, Kyle. There&#39;s no Jewpacabra. Now please, Kyle, &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s Easter eve, and if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a HEAP of &#34;
 &#34;trouble!  No! Kyle, no! Wait! I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t help it! Kyle?! Please, &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I &#34;
 &#34;mean... I mean, I don&#39;t have any money! I&#39;m totally broke!  Oh God, I am in &#34;
 &#34;a heap of trouble.  It&#39;s so cool that, even though I&#39;m Christian I celebrate &#34;
 &#39;Passover too.  Yep. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize &#39;
 &#39;with those Jews in ancient Egypt. I really do. &#39;,
 &#39;Bobo?  Bobo no!  Eh! What the? &#39;,
 &#39;Uh, what, what ha- Ugh. Oh, what? &#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s going on?!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s raining frogs!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;raining frogs?!&#39;,
 &#39;So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of... mean to frogs. Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34;What? Okay look! I&#39;ll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he&#39;ll change his mind.&#34;,
 &#39;What does that mean?&#39;,
 &#34;...Well that doesn&#39;t seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make &#34;
 &#39;Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re wrong Kyle! God is not a dick! &#34;,
 &#39;Daaaad? When is it gonna stop raining frogs?&#39;,
 &#34;But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we&#39;ve had all these plagues and &#34;
 &#34;stuff is &#39;cause you won&#39;t let all the Jews leave.&#34;,
 &#34;Wow, that makes sense. I don&#39;t think anyone can deny that. .&#34;,
 &#34;But Daaad, my friend Kyle says that if we don&#39;t do whatever the Hebrews want &#34;
 &#39;us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.&#39;,
 &#39;I love you Dad. &#39;,
 &#39;And our love grooows.&#39;,
 &#39;River of the Nile&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s close.&#34;,
 &#39; Have no fear, for God is near, and God loves all his children-&#39;,
 &#39;NOOOOOOOO!  Kyle, why?! What are you doing?!&#39;,
 &#34;No Kyle! I don&#39;t believe you!&#34;,
 &#39;NOOOOOOO!&#39;,
 &#39; NOOOOOOO! &#39;,
 &#34;Noooo, the bread&#39;s all flaaat! Noooo!  Noooooo!&#34;,
 &#34;We were wrong! I&#39;m sorry God, I&#39;ll be Jewish, I promise! Please don&#39;t kill &#34;
 &#34;me! Don&#39;t kill me, NOOOO! &#34;,
 &#34;NOOO! It&#39;s the bread, it&#39;s just so flat! No!&#34;,
 &#39;No... no...&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m alive!  I&#39;m alive, you guys!  I don&#39;t know how, but I&#39;m alive!  Can you &#34;
 &#34;believe it?! It&#39;s a miracle!  Hello everybody. Last night I almost died. But &#34;
 &#39;then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra pass me over. And by the &#39;
 &#39;power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learned a big lesson. &#39;
 &#34;It&#39;s wrong, guys. Christ didn&#39;t die for our sins and God is angry. It&#39;s time &#34;
 &#39;for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and &#39;
 &#39;deny Christ.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys. Listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Knowing your religiion &#39;
 &#34;is right but being laughed at by everyone else? It&#39;s so hard for us Jews. &#34;
 &#34;But, I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they&#39;re gonna &#34;
 &#39;believe.&#39;,
 &#34;Ah I know what you&#39;re thinking Kyle. Butu I really do believe in Judaism &#34;
 &#34;now. I&#39;m not lying.&#34;,
 &#39;Cool. Thanks, Kyle.  Oh, and Kyle, Happy Passover.&#39;,
 &#34;Nonono, I&#39;m tellin&#39; you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but &#34;
 &#34;pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin&#39; songs about their &#34;
 &#34;vujayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relaionships; now it&#39;s all &#34;
 &#39;&#34;my vujayjay this, my vujayjay that.&#34; But clearly that\&#39;s what sells. Think &#39;
 &#34;about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn&#39;t see &#34;
 &#34;some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vujayjay?  See? You can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;remember.&#39;,
 &#39;He has a point.&#39;,
 &#39;I have balls.&#39;,
 &#39;Still balls.&#39;,
 &#34; Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let&#39;s play! You can touch me anywhere &#34;
 &#39;except for my vujayjay.&#39;,
 &#39; My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vujayjay says no-o&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. &#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since &#34;
 &#34;you walked out on the video, you don&#39;t get to come! &#34;,
 &#39;The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!&#39;,
 &#39;Somebody help us! &#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, hurry! &#39;,
 &#39; Oh God!&#39;,
 &#34;Noo nono, I&#39;m not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.&#34;,
 &#34;Look at his lip.  You&#39;ve got herpes, dude.&#34;,
 &#34;No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It&#39;s actually herpes.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!&#39;,
 &#39;Ziplining. Hell yeah.&#39;,
 &#34; We were in a good mood, just jokin&#39; around, you know, mostly making fun of &#34;
 &#34;Kenny&#39;s herpes.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick &#39;
 &#39;Kenny! No! Gross.&#39;,
 &#34;Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it&#39;s just a fever blister.  You &#34;
 &#34;sound like a chick, Kenny. That&#39;s herpes, dude. You got that shit till you &#34;
 &#39;die.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright!&#39;,
 &#39; Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... &#39;
 &#34;that&#39;s when we had to watch the safety video. &#34;,
 &#39;...No.&#39;,
 &#39;Finally!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, come on, we don&#39;t have a choice. &#34;,
 &#39;Mmmm, mo...&#39;,
 &#34;The trees&#39; biology?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Zipliiine. &#39;,
 &#34;Totally fuckin&#39; stupid, dude!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah dude, it&#39;s fuckin&#39; boring as shit!&#34;,
 &#39; &#34;The next zipline? What are you talking about?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;NOOOO!&#39;,
 &#39;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m so fucking bored! &#34;,
 &#39;We should have never listened to you, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah you! In the park this morning?! &#34;I know, let\&#39;s all go ziplining! &#39;
 &#39;We\&#39;ve never done that before!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;I brought it up because you already brought it up!&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck you Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39;Nnnn-mo...&#39;,
 &#34;Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something&#39;s wrong in my tummy! &#34;,
 &#39;This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of &#39;
 &#39;Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.&#39;,
 &#39;If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;NOOO! &#39;,
 &#39; Eeeeugh.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh oh. &#39;,
 &#39;A marina?&#39;,
 &#34;Well it&#39;s not my diarrhea&#39;s fault that you took us all ziplining, you &#34;
 &#34;fuckin&#39; Jew!&#34;,
 &#34;Kennywhose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle&#39;s?&#34;,
 &#39;WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!&#34;,
 &#39;No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, &#39;
 &#34;YOU&#39;re the bastard!&#34;,
 &#39;You??&#39;,
 &#39; You... You killed Kenny! &#39;,
 &#39; It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.&#39;,
 &#39;You came for us!&#39;,
 &#39; We were saved. It was over.&#39;,
 &#34; No, I didn&#39;t get herpes, I just had a cold sore.&#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s diet, dude. Diet soda doesn&#39;t give you diarrhea. &#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34; Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we&#39;re not &#34;
 &#34;gonna start\tputting claims on her and getting into big fights! It&#39;s gonna &#34;
 &#39;be her choice who she likes the most.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God. Token, aren&#39;t you stoked?  Aww, that&#39;s awesome, Token. I&#39;m happy &#34;

 &#39;Hey, ah, Nichole, right?&#39;,
 &#39;Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen &#39;
 &#34;uh, I heard through the grapevine that you&#39;ve got a thing for Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;Just, the grapevine. Um, there&#39;s something you should probably know.  Oh man &#34;
 &#39;this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, &#39;
 &#39;...together?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, he&#39;s my man. I&#39;m more out than Kyle is, but... it&#39;s tough, because he &#34;
 &#34;acts like we&#39;re not a couple at school because he&#39;s embarassed, but... we &#34;
 &#34;get home and he&#39;s the best boyfriend I&#39;ve ever had.&#34;,
 &#34;Coll, just, you know, don&#39;t touch me &#39;cause I&#39;m not into girls, so it kind &#34;
 &#39;of grosses me out.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, &#39;
 &#39;bitch. &#39;,
 &#39;Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym &#39;
 &#34;teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys&#39; locker room.&#34;,
 &#34; Let&#39;s just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be &#34;
 &#39;practically married.&#39;,
 &#39;No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, &#39;
 &#34;but sometimes, you&#39;ve gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.&#34;,
 &#34;Guys! Guys, get outside! It&#39;s the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! &#34;,
 &#39; Oh my God, this is sooo cute.&#39;,
 &#39; Ohhhhh my God.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re my ray of sunshine, Cupid-Me. &#34;,
 &#34;I see the questions in your eyes. I know what&#39;s weighing on your mind. You &#34;
 &#34;can be sure I know, my heart. Girl I&#39;ll stand beside you through the years &#34;

 &#39;Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her &#39;
 &#39;instead. &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just so... perfect.&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, Jesus Christ!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?&#39;,
 &#39;Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and &#39;
 &#39;Nichole! They belong together!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh! Oh, I&#39;m a I&#39;m a racist, huh?! I&#39;m a racist! It&#39;s how nature works, Kyle! &#34;
 &#39;Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence &#39;
 &#39;that they ended up together?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh did they? Uh I hadn&#39;t heard about that.&#34;,
 &#39;Shh, quiet, Cupid-Me.&#39;,
 &#39;Nothing.&#39;,
 &#39;Nobody.&#39;,
 &#39;Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at &#39;
 &#39;how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just &#39;
 &#39;homophobic?!&#39;,
 &#39;Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up &#39;
 &#39;in there?! &#39;,
 &#34;Jesus Christ, Cupid-Me, you givin&#39; birth in there?!&#34;,
 &#39;That-s al- Oh, Cupid-Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it&#39;s cute, it&#39;s little chocolate &#34;
 &#39;hearts.&#39;,

 &#34;Everything&#39;s great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you &#34;
 &#39;silly!  Noohoho! &#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s not fair! They were so... happy!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each &#34;
 &#39;other!&#39;,
 &#34;No they won&#39;t!&#34;,
 &#34;No they won&#39;t! Fuck you Butters, you&#39;re an asshole!&#34;,
 &#39;And you! I should never have believed in you!&#39;,
 &#34; I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin&#39;! Die! &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right... That&#39;s right!  Ohhh.  I&#39;m so sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have doubted &#34;
 &#39;you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. &#39;
 &#39;Do you hear me? I believe in you.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, I do, Cupid-Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you &#39;
 &#39;can change everything.&#39;,
 &#34;Please, I can&#39;t do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little &#34;
 &#39;flicker of twinkle stars. &#39;,
 &#39;Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.&#39;,
 &#34;Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It&#39;s very important.&#34;,
 &#39;Denver Nuggets game?&#39;,
 &#39; NOOOOOOO! &#39;,
 &#39;Nooooooo!&#39;,
 &#39; NOOOOOOO. &#39;,
 &#39;No time! WAAAIT!&#39;,
 &#39;Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who &#39;
 &#34;have just ended a rlationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can&#39;t just &#34;
 &#39;run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work &#39;
 &#39;at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still &#39;
 &#34;have to hold on! With both hands!  Don&#39;t let society dictate who you can and &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t be with. Kyle, I love you man. You can run all you want, try to &#34;
 &#34;pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there&#39;s magic! Don&#39;t let it &#34;
 &#39;go, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39;I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise &#39;
 &#39;you nothing but love and happiness. I swear by the moon and the stars in the &#39;
 &#39;sky (Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is &#39;
 &#39;activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on &#39;
 &#34;the right) I&#39;ll be there, Kyle I swear  like a shadow that&#39;s by your side &#34;
 &#34;Kyle, swear to God I&#39;ll be there. For better or worse (Brad appears: &#34;
 &#39;&#34;better or worse&#34;), till death do us part (Brad: &#34;death do us part&#34;) I\&#39;ll &#39;
 &#39;love you with (Cartman and Brad) every gay beat of my heart!&#39;,
 &#39;I swear, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#34;Thank you! Thank you all. That&#39;s all I wanted to say. That and... The &#34;
 &#34;Bat-Mobile&#39;s outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! &#34;
 &#34;It&#39;s outside.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my gohhhd, so cute! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, Cupid-Me. People who are the same belong together.&#34;,
 &#39;Really??&#39;,
 &#39;What?! Fuck you, Cupid-Me!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, stop it!&#39;,
 &#39;Nooo!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s true.&#34;,
 &#34; Let&#39;s do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.&#34;,
 &#39;Who needs a coach? We have Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Butters, you got a minute?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I&#39;m no &#34;
 &#34;good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I&#39;m so good at &#34;
 &#39;sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.&#39;,
 &#34;No, I just don&#39;t have the mojo you have, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;...I don&#39;t have a dad.&#34;,
 &#39;Youuu save it all?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?&#39;,
 &#34;Hm, it&#39;s kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.&#34;,
 &#39; Holy shit I think I do.&#39;,
 &#34;That kid is provoking us! He&#39;s saying mean things to try and piss us off.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s because you&#39;re too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you &#34;
 &#39;need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.&#39;,
 &#39; Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not fat, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m not fat! I don&#39;t drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! &#34;,
 &#34;See what I mean? You can&#39;t even walk around a Wall*Mart anymore without &#34;
 &#39;getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn &#39;
 &#39;filling.  Holy hell yes!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah... Yeah, here you go. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kyle, caan I come in for a second?&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;ve been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall*Mart.  &#34;
 &#34;You&#39;re right Kyle. I&#39;m fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying &#34;
 &#39;&#34;No, I\&#39;m big-boned&#34; or &#34;no, that\&#39;s just muscle&#34;... It was always just me &#39;
 &#34;living in denial. I&#39;m fucking fat, Kyle. I&#39;m fucking fat as fucking fuck.&#34;,
 &#34; No! It&#39;s okay, Kyle... because... I&#39;m not gonna live like some... slug who &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t even leave his house &#39;cause he can&#39;t get around. Now that I can admit &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds &#34;
 &#34;and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It&#39;s got a &#34;
 &#39;basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. &#39;,
 &#34; Dude, it&#39;s sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters &#34;
 &#39;everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall*Mart and never have to &#39;
 &#39;touch the floor, once. &#39;,
 &#34; Hmm.  I can&#39;t.  I can&#39;t seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You&#39;ve gottam make your bathroom &#34;
 &#34;accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won&#39;t be able to take a shit in &#34;
 &#39;your house. &#39;,
 &#34;that&#39;s not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to &#34;
 &#34;code for my mobility scooter.  It&#39;s the law.&#34;,
 &#34; Can&#39;t seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;appear to be handicap-accessible.  I&#39;ll look past it this time, but you&#39;d &#34;
 &#34;better get that bathroom up to code of you don&#39;t want a lawsuit.  Well, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39; Out of the way. Out of the way please. &#39;,
 &#39;Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the &#39;
 &#34;line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I&#39;m just mortified, &#34;
 &#34;you guys. Can&#39;t believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There&#39;s a wait for &#34;
 &#34;the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the moddle isn&#39;t even fat! Look at &#34;
 &#34;hiim! He&#39;s got no right to be on a Rascal! You&#39;re not fooling anybody &#34;
 &#39;asshole! Walk to the back of the line!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  &#39;Scuse me. Move it.&#34;,
 &#39;And so to go thruogh all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and &#39;
 &#39;daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  &#39;
 &#34;At Besty Buy I&#39;m sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your &#34;
 &#34;mobility scooter can&#39;t fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It&#39;s just so &#34;
 &#39;belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After &#39;
 &#34;all I&#39;ve been through, can&#39;t I just take a dump at Best Buy?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, it&#39;s nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. &#34;,
 &#39;What, Kyle?! &#39;,
 &#39; You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country &#39;
 &#39;people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is is exactly what Adele is talking about!  &#39;
 &#34;Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna &#39;
 &#39;stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a &#39;
 &#39;day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be &#39;
 &#39;ashmed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then &#39;
 &#39;putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to &#39;
 &#34;look!  I&#39;m not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I&#39;m gonna shop sitting &#34;
 &#39;down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because &#39;
 &#34;someone needs a mobility scooter doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re an ignorant piece of &#34;
 &#34;white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I&#39;m not Honey Boo Boo!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh yeah, that&#39;s good. That&#39;s accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit &#34;
 &#39;in this real quick. &#39;,
 &#39;It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of &#39;
 &#39;yourself!&#39;,
 &#34;Making money off of people&#39;s handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet &#34;
 &#39;my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and &#39;
 &#39;desist order! That show is not going to air!&#39;,
 &#39;What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!&#39;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! &#34;
 &#39;That bitch is going down! &#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re goin&#39; down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m pissed!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m fat andn I&#39;m pissed!&#34;,
 &#34;I ain&#39;t done with you, bitch!&#34;,
 &#39; Bitch! &#39;,
 &#39;Dude, no way!&#39;,
 &#34; Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn&#39;t consensual?&#34;,
 &#34;Isn&#39;t it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about &#34;
 &#39;this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of &#39;
 &#34;sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle&#39;s mom?&#34;,
 &#39;No- hear me out, you guys. Haven\&#39;t you seen those ADT commercials? &#34;Women &#39;
 &#39;these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad &#39;
 &#39;daylight.&#34; It may be too late for Kyle\&#39;s mom, but I\&#39;m getting some &#39;
 &#39;Goddamned security!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no, really?&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven&#39;t you seen their commercials?! You can &#34;
 &#39;get raped by a white guy these ddays, Mom!&#39;,
 &#39;What-what do you mean?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I &#39;
 &#34;couldn&#39;t find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah Mom! There&#39;s dangerous people trying to screw us both!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh fuck.  Oh what&#39;s the- Goddamnit!  Hello?&#34;,
 &#34;Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can&#39;t remember the code to turn off &#34;
 &#39;the alarm!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, &#39;
 &#39;Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.&#39;,
 &#34;Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I&#39;ve got it &#34;
 &#39;written down here sonewhere.&#39;,
 &#39;Sorry about this.&#39;,
 &#39;\&#39;Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean &#34;That\&#39;s &#39;
 &#39;alright&#34;! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s nice, you&#39;re so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing &#34;
 &#34;the password, but how do you know I&#39;m not making it up?! I could have my mom &#34;
 &#39;twice by now!&#39;,
 &#34; I do, but you don&#39;t know that! I could by Kyle trying to take more of my &#34;
 &#39;shit!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, alright? Now &#34;
 &#39;as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, &#39;
 &#39;then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he&#39;s about to rape my mom.  Go &#34;
 &#34;go, she&#39;s upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he&#39;s white!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking &#39;
 &#39;raped!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s goin&#39; up the stairs, dude, you&#39;d better hurry!&#34;,
 &#34;Well that&#39;s nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, &#34;
 &#34;&#39;cause the guy&#39;s gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!&#34;,
 &#39; Who is there?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?&#39;,
 &#34;A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn&#39;t sign up to have &#34;
 &#39;some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!&#39;,
 &#39;Heh- hello?&#39;,
 &#34;No, everything&#39;s not alright. How come a guy from India is calling me when &#34;
 &#39;my house is being broken into?!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of &#34;
 &#39;the Earth try and protect me!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I&#39;m so relieved! Thanks. There&#39;s still just one &#34;
 &#34;lttle problem: How do you know I didn&#39;t break into this house, set off the &#34;
 &#34;alarm, and now I&#39;m stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have &#34;
 &#39;actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done &#39;
 &#39;absolutely nothing about it?!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! &#39;,
 &#34; HaHA Kyle! Let&#39;s see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! &#34;,
 &#34;Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody&#39;s stuff, you should &#34;
 &#39;look elsewhere.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has &#39;
 &#34;INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I&#39;m protected from ALL you greedy little Jews &#34;
 &#39;until you and your people DIE OUT!&#39;,
 &#39;What?  Hello?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set &#39;
 &#39;off my INsecurity.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s um... it&#39;s uloveboobs.&#34;,
 &#39;No, &#34;uloveboobs.&#34; Lower-case u love boobs.&#39;,
 &#39;My password is uloveboobs!&#39;,
 &#34;You, it&#39;s fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!&#34;,
 &#34;Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you&#39;d better watch ih-!  Kyle? Goddamnit.&#34;,
 &#34; Yeah, no, false alarm again. I&#39;m in the store and some fat bitch asked me &#34;
 &#39;if my dad likes cologne.&#39;,
 &#34; Goddamnit I&#39;ve had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was &#34;
 &#39;getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are &#39;
 &#39;complete retards!  Hello? &#39;,
 &#34; It doesn&#39;t matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have &#34;
 &#39;respected my authoritay. &#39;,
 &#39;FELLAS! Fellas!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!&#34;,
 &#39;It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin &#39;
 &#34;shots, and out of nowhere Butters said he&#39;s sick of people with diabetes &#34;
 &#39;feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just &#39;
 &#39;started whaling on him!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he &#34;
 &#39;locked himself in the bathroom! &#39;,
 &#34;Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters&#39; best friend. You goys gonna make out, &#34;
 &#39;Kenny? &#39;,
 &#39;...Wow.&#39;,
 &#39;Holy shitballs! Holy shitballs! Guess what, you guys? Holy shitballs. &#39;,
 &#34;Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he&#39;s going to Hawaii.&#34;,
 &#39;He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of &#39;
 &#39;my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. &#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re actually on our way over to Kyle&#39;s because our costumes are so &#34;
 &#39;multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.&#39;,
 &#39;Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?&#39;,
 &#34;Yyeah, really cool, guys. You&#39;ll be some stiff compettion at the costume &#34;
 &#39;contest for sure.&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;ll just have to wait and see.&#34;,
 &#34; Stan can&#39;t come?? But he&#39;s fucking Captain America!&#34;,
 &#34;This is fucking ridiculous! We&#39;ve been planning this Halloween for two &#34;
 &#39;moonths, and Stan has to go and ruin it!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people &#39;
 &#39;are gonna be like, &#34;Oh wow, it\&#39;s the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime &#39;
 &#39;skateboard guy!&#34; &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not Bruce Vilanch!&#34;,
 &#39;The Incredible...&#39;,
 &#34;No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I&#39;m green!&#34;,
 &#34;The person I&#39;m dressed as is not fat, and not gay!&#34;,
 &#34; JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It&#39;s Stan&#39;s stupid Captain America &#34;
 &#34;costume! That&#39;s what&#39;s throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to &#34;
 &#34;get that I&#39;m the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#39;Dude dude dude! Check it out. &#39;,
 &#34; You guys, we&#39;ve gotta stop it!&#34;,
 &#39;Cartman SMASH! &#39;,
 &#34; Oh crap, there&#39;s a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this &#34;
 &#39;guy.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh my God. You mean they don&#39;t know people can stream movies cheaper and &#34;
 &#39;more conveniently online?&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!&#39;,
 &#34; I can&#39;t believe we all got duped. I&#39;ve been wearin&#39; this stupid things for &#34;
 &#39;months! I feel like such a tool.&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, let&#39;s do this! Make me believe in something that&#39;s bullshit, will &#34;
 &#34;you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let&#39;s see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good &#34;
 &#39;riddance to YOU! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeup, it&#39;s done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh don&#39;t even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn&#39;t buy into the &#34;
 &#34;bracelets doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re smarter than me, okay?!  What&#39;s wrong with &#34;
 &#39;him?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh huh.&#39;,
 &#34;So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell?? You&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;wearing a &#34;What Would Jesus Do&#34; bracelet!&#39;,
 &#34;The big whoop isn&#39;t that you have one, the big whoop is that you&#39;re still &#34;
 &#39;wearing it!&#39;,
 &#34;Well don&#39;t you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really &#34;
 &#39;cheated by all this!&#39;,
 &#39;Craig?? You asshole!&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, what&#39;s this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, I don&#39;t give a crap about using recycled plastic!&#34;,
 &#39;...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.&#39;,
 &#39; Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and &#39;
 &#39;a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;...Fuck! Dude, weak. &#39;,
 &#34; Mom? Mommy? Where&#39;s my mommy?&#34;,
 &#39;MOM!&#39;,
 &#39;She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.&#39;,
 &#34;Mom?? Where&#39;s my mom??&#34;,
 &#39; &#34;Warm nuts,&#34; she said.&#39;,
 &#39;Mon?! I lost my Mooohhm!&#39;,
 &#39; No way dude. No way.&#39;,
 &#34;MOOOM! I can&#39;t find my mooom!&#34;,
 &#34;Ahaha, okay okay it&#39;s getting old. &#34;,
 &#39;MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey Kyle. What&#39;s up?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I figured. The day after the elections though, you&#39;re probably sitting &#34;
 &#39;on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a &#39;
 &#39;democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, cuould you come ove for a second? I got &#39;
 &#34;somethin&#39; I need to show you.&#34;,
 &#34;Please, Kyle. It&#39;s kind of important.&#34;,
 &#39;You happey with the election results last night, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, that&#39;s such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you &#34;
 &#39;that I have something in my room that oculd change the entire election? &#39;,
 &#39;What if I did, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Pretty sweet, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s it look like? Hundreds of thousands of vote from all the swing &#34;
 &#39;states.&#39;,
 &#39;No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask &#39;
 &#39;me.&#39;,
 &#34; Funny how voting works in this country, isn&#39;t it, Kyle.  Each one of these, &#34;
 &#39;a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. &#39;
 &#39;Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was &#39;
 &#39;heard. &#39;,
 &#34; Here&#39;s another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all &#34;
 &#39;those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. &#39;,
 &#39;Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have &#39;
 &#39;to promise not to tell anyone.&#39;,
 &#34;Run now, little firefly. It&#39;s all part of the plan.&#34;,
 &#34;Thanks Mom,  I&#39;ll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don&#39;t think I &#34;
 &#34;have a study. That&#39;s fine.&#34;,
 &#39; Hmmm, no.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I know my rights. You can&#39;t search my room without a warrant. &#34;
 &#34;And I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you permission.&#34;,
 &#34;Ey! You can&#39;t do that! Ey!&#34;,
 &#39;I know my rights! Stop right now! &#39;,
 &#39;I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the &#39;
 &#39;one thing that made America different was that government could never barge &#39;
 &#34;into our lives unwarranteded. but it&#39;s all changing, isn&#39;t it? Ever since &#34;
 &#34;Obama was first elected, it&#39;s all changing.&#34;,
 &#39;But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the &#39;
 &#39;election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. &#39;,
 &#39;Mm, mhm, mhm.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal &#34;
 &#39;a little bit.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. Tell me exactly what you plan on doing with it?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh Goddamnit Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.&#39;,
 &#34;So here&#39;s the deal, General Tsao, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the &#34;
 &#34;sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker&#39;s son. Cartman Skywalker.&#34;,
 &#34;Well then, I guess we&#39;re about to play a game of Chicken, General Tsao. &#34;,
 &#34;Butters.  You just couldn&#39;t keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?&#34;,
 &#34;I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can&#39;t trust anyone. &#34;
 &#39;Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.&#39;,
 &#34;Shhh, it&#39;s okay, Butters.  Nobodu&#39;s gonna find the election ballots.  I have &#34;
 &#39;them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A plce in town people &#39;
 &#39;barely even know exists.&#39;,
 &#39;Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney &#39;
 &#39;would have been tougher on the Chinese!&#39;,
 &#34;Trust me: they&#39;re somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then &#34;
 &#39;Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese &#39;
 &#39;forever!&#39;,
 &#34;I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you&#39;ll have to do &#34;
 &#39;better than that!&#39;,
 &#39;I want a part in the new movies!&#39;,
 &#34;I get to be Luke Skeywalker&#39;s son. And there has to be a character called &#34;
 &#39;Jewbacca.&#39;,
 &#39;Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing &#39;
 &#34;to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I&#39;m gonna smuggle them here, &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.&#34;,
 &#39;Haha.&#39;,
 &#39;Haha. &#39;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t think so, General Tsao! This way, officers! &#34;,
 &#34;Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy&#39;s sake, right Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;No! But Obama wasn&#39;t really elected! Don&#39;t you people care?! &#34;,
 &#34; Yeah, I know dude. I&#39;m tellng you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.&#34;,
 &#39;Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like &#34;Dude, Cartman, we need &#39;
 &#39;you to keep playing defense!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but I was like &#34;I can\&#39;t you guys. I twisted my ankle.&#34; In the end &#39;
 &#39;though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, &#39;
 &#34;you know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&#34;,
 &#39; Kyle, this is a private conversation.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s that kid Kyle again. He&#39;s a total boner, always listening in on &#34;
 &#39;my calls.&#39;,
 &#39;Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, &#39;
 &#34;remember how I was tellin&#39; you the NSA listens to everyone&#39;s phone calls and &#34;
 &#39;reads all our e-mails?&#39;,
 &#39;Who is that? Is that Toby&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence&#39;s?&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re what? What, you say?&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, &#34;
 &#34;and we don&#39;t have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think &#34;
 &#39;everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. /did you guys &#39;
 &#39;read &#34;1984&#34;?&#39;,
 &#34;See, I didn&#39;t read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa &#34;
 &#39;Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;d be what?&#34;,
 &#39;I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our &#39;
 &#34;private lives! I&#39;m gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I &#34;
 &#34;seriously feel like I&#39;m being spied on right now.  I&#39;m sure the govrernment &#34;
 &#34;has a file on me a mile long; that&#39;s why this is so important, you know?  &#34;
 &#39;Hang on, I\&#39;m gonna make a video blog for my &#34;Stop Listening To Me&#34; Web &#39;
 &#34;site.  What&#39;s up everybody? It&#39;s me again, just kicking it at my skeal. &#34;
 &#34;There&#39;s gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering &#34;
 &#34;information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, &#39;cause &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, I really can&#39;t hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the &#39;
 &#39;directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?&#39;,
 &#34;Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he&#39;ll bring &#34;
 &#39;petition forms. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh heeell NO you didn&#39;t just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST &#34;
 &#39;STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an &#39;
 &#39;NSA agent right here at our school&#39;,
 &#39;That just so you know, the government is watching everythng you do! Always &#39;
 &#34;watching! They say it&#39;s to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? &#34;,
 &#39;Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is &#39;
 &#34;tracking me! We&#39;re gonna have to put off the rally.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had &#34;Grand Theft Auto V,&#34; &#39;
 &#39;and it says, &#34;you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek.&#34; &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that &#34;
 &#34;unless the government is keepin&#39; tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the &#34;
 &#39;rally, we have to go hard core!&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, listen. I&#39;m gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I&#39;m gonna put all &#34;
 &#39;their secrets up on Twitter.&#39;,
 &#34;No! Dude, I&#39;m gonna sneak into their headwuarters disguised as an employee, &#34;
 &#34;and I&#39;m gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey &#34;
 &#39;Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. &#39;
 &#34;If I&#39;m gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, &#34;
 &#34;then I&#39;m gonna need something better than Twitter.&#34;,
 &#39;What, they already have something better than Twitter?&#39;,
 &#39;No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, because the government won&#39;t respect my privacy.&#34;,
 &#39;Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, I&#39;m here to apply for the NSA job?&#34;,
 &#39;Bill Clinton.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.&#39;,
 &#39;I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.&#39;,
 &#39; I was um, sure that the appointment was today.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, so um, as I&#39;m going through people&#39;s e-mails and phone calls, um, how &#34;
 &#39;do I know which people to start with?&#39;,
 &#39;Really? How big is my file?&#39;,
 &#39;Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All &#39;
 &#39;his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.&#39;,
 &#34;Uhh trust me, he&#39;s not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his &#34;
 &#39;status to &#34;ripped and sweet.&#34;  \&#39;Scuse me. Excuse me! There\&#39;s a very &#39;
 &#34;important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;status!&#39;,
 &#39;Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is &#39;
 &#34;the NSA&#39;s worst nightmare!&#34;,
 &#39;The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!&#39;,
 &#34; Can&#39;t do anything?? You&#39;re the NSA!&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;,
 &#39;Get their hands on what?  Dude... &#39;,
 &#34;You think I&#39;m fat and unimportant now??!!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#39;news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, AND &#39;
 &#34;on Alec Baldwin&#39;s new television show, via Shitter!&#34;,
 &#39;&#39;,
 &#39;You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the &#39;
 &#34;truth! And everyone&#39;s gonna think I&#39;m superkewl!&#34;,
 &#34; It didn&#39;t work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I &#34;
 &#39;thought everyone woule be super-pissed off at what I exposed about the &#39;
 &#39;government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in &#39;
 &#39;on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible &#39;
 &#39;machiiiine!&#39;,
 &#39;Why not throw him into jail like everybody eeeelse?! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not gonna be okay because now I&#39;m a whistleblower against my country &#34;
 &#34;and I&#39;m gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! &#34;,
 &#39;I do toooo!&#39;,
 &#39;Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.&#39;,
 &#39;...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the &#34;
 &#39;Commie dwarfs.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;,
 &#39;I can be forgiven?&#39;,
 &#34;For everything bad I&#39;ve ever done?&#34;,
 &#39;And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something &#39;
 &#34;wrong and admit it and I&#39;m forgiven again?&#34;,
 &#34; Thta&#39;s pretty kewl.&#34;,
 &#39;I do, I love my country!&#39;,
 &#39;I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!&#39;,
 &#39;Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!&#39;,
 &#39;Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.&#39;,
 &#39;Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not booing your opinion, I&#39;m booing your report topic. No one even knows &#34;
 &#39;what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s more like it.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?&#39;,
 &#39;You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.&#39;,
 &#39;Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys?  You guys, you&#39;d better get over here.&#34;,
 &#34;Butters&#39; dad killed his mom. &#34;,
 &#39;Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching &#39;
 &#34;murder porn, and now they&#39;re screwing up Minecraft too! &#34;,
 &#34;And why was that?! Because one kid&#39;s dad actually went and killed his mom! &#34;
 &#34;For all we know, that kid&#39;s parents have been doing drugs and cheating on &#34;
 &#34;each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin&#39; to do with it!&#34;,
 &#39;Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, we&#39;ve gotta do something.&#34;,
 &#39;Something he said. Did you hear him? He said &#34;Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my &#39;
 &#39;nono!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;You know, if I&#39;d been caught lying about something, that&#39;s exactly what I &#34;
 &#39;would have said.&#39;,
 &#34;Sonofabiiitch!  Don&#39;t you think there are enough griefers in the world &#34;
 &#39;without our parents being shown this stuff?!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey Token!  What&#39;s up, bro?&#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Nothin\&#39;&#34; Me neither. Nothin\&#39;s goin\&#39; on. Sucks.  Everything good with &#39;
 &#39;you?&#39;,
 &#34;Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin&#39;?&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m just hangin&#39; out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn&#39;t for &#34;
 &#34;African-Americans, we wouldn&#39;t have Rock &amp; Roll? So cool that we have a &#34;
 &#39;black President.  About time. &#39;,
 &#39;Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang &#39;
 &#39;out? &#39;,
 &#34;God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I&#39;ll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. &#34;
 &#39;Fist bump, bro. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You thinkk something&#39;s wrong? &#34;,
 &#39;Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad &#39;
 &#34;Pitt!  Hey Token. What&#39;s up, bro?  Fist bump? &#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s Token. I think he&#39;s a ticking time bomb.&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he &#34;
 &#34;won&#39;t forget.&#34;,
 &#34;But it wasn&#39;t me, it wasn&#39;t my fault!&#34;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s too gay. It would only make things worse.&#34;,
 &#34;M&#39;kay. Ahah-I&#39;ll be okay.&#34;,
 &#34;M&#39;kay.&#34;,
 &#39;No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah &#39;
 &#39;Token, Token!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Token? How are you doing?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m so stoked that we&#39;re best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist &#34;
 &#39;bump. &#39;,
 &#34;No! My wife, Token! Token, that&#39;s my wife!&#34;,
 &#39;No Token! Stop peekng at my daughter! NOOO! &#39;,
 &#39;Agreed.&#39;,
 &#39;Hoh boy, here we go.&#39;,
 &#34; Token, I wasn&#39;t on that jury. Okay?&#34;,
 &#34;This grudge that you&#39;re holding against an entire group of people should be &#34;
 &#39;directed at just a few, not at me.&#39;,
 &#39;I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It\&#39;s called &#34;I Was Not The &#39;
 &#39;Bullet.&#34;  I was not the bullet. I was not the gun. I was not the juror that &#39;
 &#39;set the shooter free. I was not the trigger. I was not the hate. Nor was I &#39;
 &#39;the judge, but still, you judge me? I was not the black family mourning for &#39;
 &#39;the dead. &#34;Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?&#34; I was &#39;
 &#39;not the verdict.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s going to rhyme, Token, just hold on. I was not the shooter. I was not &#34;
 &#34;the gun. So Token, you should be cool while we&#39;re all here at school. &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s gonna be okay. I think we&#39;re all safe now.&#34;,
 &#39;Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! &#39;,
 &#39;Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! &#39;
 &#34;White people got you beat, black people; you&#39;d better represent! Let me hear &#34;
 &#39;you say &#34;I don\&#39;t blame the white people. Nono no!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Token, calm down.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! &#39;,
 &#34;Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We&#39;ve gotta get the fuck out &#34;
 &#34;of here!  Mom it&#39;s starting! We&#39;ve gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, &#34;
 &#34;we&#39;ve gotta move! It&#39;s spreading! Lwt&#39;a go! &#34;,
 &#34; Driiive! You&#39;ve gotta driiive! Nooow!&#34;,
 &#39;Get to an airport!!&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If &#34;
 &#34;you wanna live, you&#39;d better step on the gas!! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? &#34;
 &#34;Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We&#39;re gonna die!! &#34;,
 &#34;The outbreak has starte! We&#39;ve gotta get the fuck out of here! &#34;,
 &#34;Get on the flight! Let&#39;s move! Let&#39;s go go go go!  Oh my God! &#34;,
 &#34;The outbreak&#39;s starting! Fly the plane now! &#34;,
 &#34;The e-... The end of the world? We&#39;ve got one shot and one shot only and &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s to find a place where the contagion won&#39;t reach us!&#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t understand. There&#39;s no Denver left to go back to! &#34;,
 &#39;Not a chance. By now most of the unban cities will be compromised. This &#39;
 &#34;whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhre the trend won&#39;t take &#34;
 &#39;hold. Like Iceland. &#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. &#34;,
 &#39;Nah! &#39;,
 &#39; One of them is in the back!&#39;,
 &#34;Totally fine? Then it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Oh my God we still ahve time!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay. We have reason to believe it hasn&#39;t spread yet.&#34;,
 &#39;His name is Token.&#39;,
 &#34;I won&#39;t do it! He used to be my friend!&#34;,
 &#34; Alright. I promise. I won&#39;t let the back people riot and destroy the world.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!&#34;,
 &#39; Come on! &#39;,
 &#39;Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can &#39;
 &#39;shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.&#39;,
 &#39;A person. &#39;,
 &#39;Threatening ALL of us!&#39;,
 &#39;What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!&#39;,
 &#39;Stand my ground?&#39;,
 &#34;Yes yes, that&#39;s what I need! I&#39;ll take that!&#34;,
 &#39; This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid &#39;
 &#34;rules?!  Wiat a minute. I can&#39;t shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want &#34;
 &#39;in Florida?&#39;,
 &#34;The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn&#39;t the only Patient Zero. The &#34;
 &#34;outbreak won&#39;t happen IF... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to &#34;
 &#39;Florida!&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go! Let&#39;s move move move move! Let&#39;s go!  Find the closest &#34;
 &#39;airport in Florida! &#39;,
 &#34;If we don&#39;t get to Florida there&#39;s not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black &#34;
 &#34;guy in the back!  Alight, now let&#39;s find Zimmerman.&#34;,
 &#39;Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going to flush out Patient Zero. And you&#39;re gonna shoot him. It&#39;s the &#34;
 &#39;only way.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, nobody can see us wearing black.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, at least I&#39;ll bet Token&#39;s glad it&#39;s over with. Aren&#39;t you, Token? &#34;,
 &#34;Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How&#39;s it goin&#39; dude? I know how it feels now.&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m sorry.&#34;,
 &#34;Uh oh.  Sounds like you&#39;re still angry, Token.&#34;,
 &#39;Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my &#39;
 &#34;ass right now. You&#39;d like to walk right up and punch ne in the face, but &#34;
 &#34;what&#39;s that gonna solve? I&#39;ve got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on &#34;
 &#39;dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. &#39;,
 &#39;That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside &#39;
 &#34;the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that&#39;s that&#39;s my ground. He &#34;
 &#34;was on it. [smiles when no one answers.&#39;&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh! Oh man. The endiing to that movie was so terrible.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. So bad.&#39;,
 &#39;Jury found me innocent, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;You interrupt people when they talk.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh man! &#39;,
 &#39;Oh boy.&#39;,
 &#34;Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you&#39;re having, &#34;
 &#39;okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re gettin&#39; detention!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah Token, that&#39;s the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.&#34;,
 &#39;Token, calm down.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh God, here we go again! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not a crane, it&#39;s a dick and balls.&#34;,
 &#39;That sucks, dude.&#39;,
 &#39;I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your &#39;
 &#39;time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a &#39;
 &#39;big pology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I &#39;
 &#39;was wrong, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. &#34;
 &#34;Yeah, yeah it&#39;s... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were &#34;
 &#39;right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin &#39;
 &#39;Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When &#39;
 &#34;Kyle said that humans weren&#39;t the only species that can have light skin and &#34;
 &#39;freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: &#39;
 &#34;there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn&#39;t believe it. I &#34;
 &#34;guess I didn&#39;t want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired &#34;
 &#39;light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?&#39;,
 &#39;There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. &#39;,
 &#39; You wwere right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen &#39;
 &#39;intellect again!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I&#39;m pretty sure this occurs &#34;
 &#39;only rarely in nature! &#39;,
 &#39;What? What joke? This is real!&#39;,
 &#39;No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you, Butters! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It&#39;s really amazing. Heheh, too good, &#34;
 &#39;too too good.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, you&#39;re right, Kyle. I&#39;m sure that that... is going to have &#34;
 &#39;earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. &#39;,
 &#39; Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, &#34;Hey, there\&#39;s a redheaded &#39;
 &#39;cow outside; you should all see it.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a &#34;
 &#39;Swiis cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn&#39;t real. I &#34;
 &#39;made him up.&#39;,
 &#39;I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you &#39;
 &#39;right in the eye and said &#34;No.&#34; I owe you an apology and, I mean it.&#39;,
 &#34; No! No, Kyle, you said that it&#39;s never for the best. Remember that? And &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re right. You&#39;re right, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#34;But it&#39;s not true. Kyle, I&#39;m being serious. I really think I have to tell &#34;
 &#34;the truth! I I don&#39;t know how I can live with this. I don&#39;t think I can &#34;
 &#34;unless eh, unless I don&#39;t know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  &#34;
 &#34;Maybe if you&#39;d said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged &#34;
 &#39;in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re right. You&#39;re right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done &#34;
 &#39;with it! &#39;,
 &#39; Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??&#39;,
 &#39;Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always toalk to you like &#39;
 &#39;that?&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. &#39;,
 &#39; Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me &#39;
 &#34;the soda from his lunch.  I think he&#39;s just really stoked on me for helping &#34;
 &#39;bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, looks like most everyone&#39;s here. Um, wasn&#39;t there something you wanted &#34;
 &#39;to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?&#39;,
 &#39;You what??&#39;,
 &#34; Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let&#39;s see what I can &#34;
 &#39;muster up here.&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s see. Oh! Oh! &#34;,
 &#39; Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?&#39;,
 &#39; Kyle, are you sure?&#39;,
 &#39;Well alright. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth &#39;
 &#39;tomorrow? Thai or Greek?&#39;,
 &#34;I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they&#39;re your yummy farts. Shold &#34;
 &#39;we go with Thai?&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? &#34;,
 &#34;Huh? You comin&#39;? &#34;,
 &#39;Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves &#39;
 &#39;tomorrow. &#39;,
 &#34;Thank you everyone. It&#39;s my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. &#34;
 &#34;Isn&#39;t that right, Fartboy?&#34;,
 &#34;Are you sure, Fartboy? I&#39;ve had a lot of strange food on this trip.&#34;,
 &#39;Small penis?!&#39;,
 &#39;No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge &#39;
 &#39;problems.&#39;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.&#34;,
 &#34;Cheer up, Kyle. I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t the first time someone who thought they &#34;
 &#39;were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about &#39;
 &#39;we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? &#39;,
 &#34;Good evening, sir. I&#39;m callig together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to &#34;
 &#39;speak with Lady McCormick.&#39;,
 &#39;Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a &#39;
 &#39;way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about &#39;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady &#39;
 &#34;McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;house. At Scott Malkinson&#39;s house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest &#34;
 &#39;battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming &#39;
 &#39;devices are hitting the shelves.&#39;,
 &#34;What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there&#39;s a way we &#34;
 &#39;can get the new gaming system.&#39;,
 &#39;I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the &#39;
 &#39;first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are &#39;
 &#39;calling it... Black Friday.&#39;,
 &#39;It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!&#39;,
 &#39;On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can &#39;
 &#39;be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the &#39;
 &#39;gaming system we need to survive.&#39;,
 &#39; Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.&#39;,
 &#34; They don&#39;t salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of &#39;
 &#39;Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!&#39;,
 &#39;But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are &#39;
 &#39;there no other factions we can call to our aid?&#39;,
 &#34;Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They&#39;re dorks, and I&#39;m not playing with them.&#34;,
 &#39;Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?&#39;,
 &#39;What do you mean?&#39;,
 &#39;Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin &#39;
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;We have word from the kindergartners. They&#39;ve agreed to join us! &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s what this is all about, Craig. We&#39;re all trying to get XBox Ones on &#34;
 &#39;Black Friday.&#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we&#39;re gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I &#34;
 &#39;was obviously talking about XBoxes.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#39;We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!&#39;,
 &#34;Fine! If you guys don&#39;t wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s fine!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh, it&#39;s gonna be like that, is it?!&#34;,
 &#39; Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control &#39;
 &#39;fonctionality. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh uh, hey guys, what&#39;s up?&#34;,
 &#39; God these guys are such dorks!&#39;,
 &#34; Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you&#39;re XBox people, &#34;
 &#39;right?&#39;,
 &#34; Oh my God they&#39;re so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we &#34;
 &#39;have a way for you to join us in getting EBox Ones super cheap.&#39;,
 &#39;The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the &#39;
 &#39;kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can &#39;
 &#34;convince Stan to come back to our side, don&#39;t you, Sir Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don&#39;t think with logic. He &#34;
 &#39;betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful &#39;
 &#39;alliances.&#39;,
 &#39; Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.&#39;,
 &#39;What new Elmo doll?&#39;,
 &#39;Lady McCorminc, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  &#34;
 &#34;switch sides,  it could make Stan&#39;s army problematic for us.&#34;,
 &#34;True, but we can&#39;t let Kyle come in the way of what&#39;s rightfully ours.  &#34;
 &#34;Let&#39;s face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox &#34;
 &#39;Ones. The others are simply there to... helo us get inside those doors.&#39;,
 &#39;You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence &#34;
 &#39;to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other.&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. Good, Federation kids. You&#39;re learning to fight with your hands! Keep &#34;
 &#34;pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony&#39;s offering a special &#34;
 &#39;Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?&#39;,
 &#34;Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn&#39;t mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;re just commiting to paying for something that some assholes in &#34;
 &#34;California haven&#39;t even finished workng on yet. You know what you get for &#34;
 &#39;pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a &#39;
 &#34;joke?! On Black Friday,, there&#39;s gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to &#34;
 &#39;get inside that mall keeping you from getting XBox Ones! So what do we do?! &#39;
 &#39;We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has &#39;
 &#39;diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! &#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s another army out there who thinks they&#39;re better than us, and we are &#34;
 &#39;not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! &#39;,
 &#39;The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.&#39;,
 &#34;That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny&#39;s doing this, right? Becaues he &#34;
 &#39;wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn\&#39;t let him!  I said, &#34;You can be a &#39;
 &#39;chick, Kenny, but there\&#39;s only one ruler, and that\&#39;s me!&#34; &#39;,
 &#39; I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday &#39;
 &#34;Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;backstabbing game. &#39;,
 &#34;Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I&#39;d like to speak to the presidentn of XBox, &#34;
 &#39;please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of &#39;
 &#39;Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I nned help blowing up PlayStation &#39;
 &#34;people... Eric Cartman. I&#39;m a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m not king of wizards, I&#39;m a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put &#34;
 &#39;the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!&#39;,
 &#39;Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he&#39;s Daenerys Targaryen. I need to &#34;
 &#39;know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in &#39;
 &#39;Game of Thrones?&#39;,
 &#39;Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?&#39;,
 &#39;So what happens when the dragons show up?&#39;,
 &#39;Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones &#39;
 &#39;model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I &#39;
 &#39;know how to deal with Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Here&#39;s two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson &#34;
 &#39;and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know &#34;
 &#34;how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let&#39;s face it, &#34;
 &#39;Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply &#39;
 &#39;there to help us get through those doors.&#39;,
 &#34; Do you mind?! We&#39;re trying to talk here!&#34;,
 &#34;Why don&#39;t you mind your own business?!&#34;,
 &#39;Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.&#39;,
 &#34;It isn&#39;t that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the &#34;
 &#39;nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors &#39;
 &#39;getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?&#39;,
 &#39;That could be up to you.&#39;,
 &#34;Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you&#39;re right.  Did you know that Stan&#39;s dad is &#34;
 &#39;working a temp job as mall security?&#39;,
 &#34;Seems a little convenient, doesn&#39;t it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to &#34;
 &#34;help him get his PS4s. Who&#39;s playing dirty now? Let&#39;s face it, Sir Kyle, &#34;
 &#39;this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to &#39;
 &#39;help us get through those doors.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, you&#39;d better stop harassing me or I&#39;m callin&#39; the cops!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;Well go ahead! Call the fuckin&#39; cops then!&#34;,
 &#39;Hi, is Kenny home?&#39;,
 &#34;Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You&#39;ve gotta turn me. &#34;,
 &#39;I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down yor weapons, and you can &#34;
 &#39;come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, &#39;kay? &#34;
 &#39;but you are never going to be a real princess!&#39;,
 &#34;That doesn&#39;t even make sense.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re outnumbered ten to one, and there&#39;s no time left! How will you win?! &#34;,
 &#39;Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.&#39;,
 &#34;Uhh, it&#39;s my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has &#34;
 &#34;certainly been a help.  But I hope that we&#39;re clear that this is my army.  &#34;
 &#34;There can only be one person of royalty; that&#39;s kind of the rules.&#34;,
 &#39;Your CEOs?&#39;,
 &#39;Uhhh, hmmm. What?&#39;,
 &#34;Why don&#39;t you stay the fuck out of my business?!&#34;,
 &#39; He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??&#39;,
 &#34;Because, because what? Because he&#39;s cute?&#34;,
 &#34;But what does he do besides that he&#39;s cute?!&#34;,
 &#34;Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don&#39;t seriously tell Bill Gates &#34;
 &#34;to suck my ass. Tell him everything&#39;s cool and I&#39;ll call him in a little &#34;
 &#39;bit. &#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not a princess, he&#39;s a DUDE!&#34;,
 &#39;So what are you saying, Kyle?!&#39;,
 &#39;A;rogjt. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms &#39;
 &#39;and give up, okay?&#39;,
 &#34;Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We&#39;ll all &#34;
 &#39;play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you &#39;
 &#39;got too many peoople on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese &#39;
 &#39;princess.&#39;,
 &#34;We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don&#39;t think you&#39;re the only ones &#34;
 &#39;that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we &#39;
 &#39;figured out how.&#39;,
 &#39; Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come &#39;
 &#39;to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. &#39;
 &#39;Yours truly, the Wizard King.&#39;,
 &#39;Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.&#39;,
 &#34;I think it&#39;s best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should &#34;
 &#39;stay back a bit from the doors. &#39;,
 &#39;Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the &#39;
 &#34;brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It&#39;s best we let &#34;
 &#39;Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip &#39;
 &#39;on by.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, that&#39;s true, but, let&#39;s face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me &#34;
 &#39;getting PlayStations. The rest are simoly there to us... get through-&#39;,
 &#39;Dude! Dude!&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, shut the fuck up!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I&#39;m in his garden &#34;
 &#39;all the time.&#39;,
 &#39;Goddamnit, shut up!&#39;,
 &#34;Well why don&#39;t you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don&#39;t you &#34;
 &#34;tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you&#39;re at it?!&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, we&#39;re not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;think the writers even knew what that was about.&#39;,
 &#34; Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin&#39; sweet, dude!  &#34;
 &#34;You&#39;re a fuckin&#39; asshole!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll shit in your fuckin&#39; garden!&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each &#39;
 &#39;other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.&#39;,
 &#39;Yesh, kewl.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, clearly she wouldn&#39;t be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.&#34;,
 &#39;Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, he did.&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s fine, Kyle. Everything&#39;s been taken care of. Stan won&#39;t be telling &#34;
 &#39;anybody anything... ever again.&#39;,
 &#39;What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all &#39;
 &#39;friends again. Our two houses brought together. Sooon we will all have our &#39;
 &#39;PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look &#39;
 &#39;stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;ll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, &#39;
 &#34;blow the whistle. We&#39;ll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks &#34;
 &#39;inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.&#39;,
 &#39;Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is this?!&#39;,
 &#34;Sir Kyle, they&#39;re about to open the mall! What are you doing?!&#34;,
 &#39;Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!&#39;,
 &#39;Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re not a part of your betrayal?&#34;,
 &#39;No. Whose betrayal is this? &#39;,
 &#39;Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.&#39;,
 &#39; Yay, XBox wins.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;d like to get XBox Ones please.&#34;,
 &#34;The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it&#39;s really a... it&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;seamless interface.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys wanna p-play outside or something? &#39;,
 &#34;I just... I can&#39;t get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy&#39;s head &#34;
 &#39;apart out of my eyes.&#39;,
 &#34;The last two weeks we&#39;ve been too busy to play video games and, look at what &#34;
 &#34;we did. There&#39;s been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do &#34;
 &#39;we need video games to play?&#39;,
 &#39;Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that &#39;
 &#39;all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just &#39;
 &#34;play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin&#39; needs them?!&#34;,
 &#34; Fuck &#39;em!&#34;,
 &#34;You guys, come on. That&#39;s not kewl. You shouldn&#39;t rip on her because she&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;fat. You should rip on her &#39;cause she&#39;s ugly. Okay? She looks like someone &#34;
 &#34;hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that&#39;s why she sucks, alright?&#34;,
 &#39; Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#39;I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh, Butters, I don&#39;t know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going &#34;
 &#39;out with Clyde.&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.&#39;,
 &#34;Did you not see Erica Smith&#39;s boobs, Kyle? They&#39;re like perfect water &#34;
 &#39;balloons.&#39;,
 &#39;Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... biber forest.&#39;,
 &#39;Protruding vaginal boner.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, I like that. &#39;,
 &#39;Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!&#39;,
 &#39;Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!&#39;,
 &#34;You guys! You guys, it&#39;s awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I&#39;ve got &#34;

 &#34;It&#39;s the greatest startup company name EVER! &#34;,
 &#39;Washington. Redskins. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s sooo sweet!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You &#34;
 &#39;can use it! Aaand the logo!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude! There&#39;s already brand name awareness and it&#39;s instantly recognizable!&#34;,
 &#34;Kyle, you&#39;re not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do &#34;
 &#39;whatever we want!&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s a strong name, dude. It&#39;s like agressive and masculine like Boner &#34;
 &#39;Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.&#39;,
 &#34;We don&#39;t stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, &#34;
 &#39;cash in, sell out, bro down.&#39;,
 &#39;I told you guyys! &#34;Washiington Redskins&#34; totally gets people\&#39;s attention!&#39;,
 &#34;Sittin&#39; on our asses, here we come!&#34;,
 &#39; By pledging just one or two dolloars, you are helpoing us in our fervent &#39;
 &#39;quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive &#39;
 &#39;this luxurious company micro badge.&#39;,
 &#34;Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we&#39;d be happy to take your &#34;
 &#39;money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, &#39;
 &#39;bye bye.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, I know.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, cool. Please take a seat.&#39;,
 &#39;Nice, I like that.&#39;,
 &#39;Stop? But why?&#39;,
 &#34;Uhhh, the trademark got pulledm so I&#39;m totaly free to use the name, &#34;
 &#39;actually. phone rings, Eric reacts Un, Butters, could you get that?&#39;,
 &#39;How is it offensive?&#39;,
 &#39;Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we nme our company &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Washingto Redskins,&#34; it was out of deep appreciation for your team nd your &#39;
 &#39;people. &#39;,
 &#34;Mmmm, Noooo, Becauuuse I doon&#39;t want to. Aaaand we can&#39;t just change the &#34;
 &#34;name of our company] &#39;cause it&#39;s like supar haaard. But hey, from one &#34;
 &#39;Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. &#39;,
 &#39;Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money &#39;
 &#39;pledged to our company becomes liquid!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start &#39;
 &#34;doind stuff now, it&#39;ll put it all at risk!&#34;,
 &#39;Digging in our hells and pissing on public opinioin us what the Washington &#39;
 &#39;Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wwanna be a successful &#39;
 &#39;business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a &#39;
 &#34;stand on something, you&#39;re pretending like your company is about more than &#34;
 &#34;money. Then all of a sudden you&#39;re the NFL and and your players get cught &#34;
 &#39;molesting little boys!&#39;,
 &#34;NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let&#39;s use the Catholic Church! You &#34;
 &#34;take a moral stand on issues, you say you&#39;re about honor and integrity, and &#34;
 &#39;the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their &#39;
 &#39;wives in an elevator!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to &#34;
 &#39;be about high morrality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten &#39;
 &#34;in an elevator and it&#39;s most likely going to be Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, what are you goona do? Go back to school? I&#39;m not going back there, &#34;
 &#39;man!&#39;,
 &#39;Well that\&#39;s fine! You can\&#39;t call yourself &#34;Washington Redskins!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I guess everything&#39;s out on the table now, huh Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?&#39;,
 &#39;Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. &#39;,
 &#39;Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! &#34;Fuck ytou.&#34; Those &#39;
 &#39;words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a &#39;
 &#39;company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on &#39;
 &#34;Kickstarter, but after today I think you&#39;ll agree that Washington Redskins &#34;
 &#39;is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forrefront &#39;
 &#39;of Kickstarer as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to &#39;
 &#39;tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show &#39;
 &#34;you all the latest innovations we&#39;ve come up with.  To begin with, we have &#34;
 &#39;moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we &#39;
 &#34;didn&#39;t stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office &#34;
 &#39;drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the &#39;
 &#39;company from the inside out. We receuved a lot of pressure from certain &#39;
 &#39;communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, &#39;
 &#39;but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our &#39;
 &#34;logo, it should be more in step with today&#39;s times, but still define us as &#34;
 &#39;the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company &#39;
 &#34;logo that I think you&#39;ll all agree is very excitiing.  Now when people hear &#34;
 &#39;the name &#34;Redskins,&#34; they will immediately think &#34;titties&#34; and &#34;balls.&#34; &#39;
 &#39;It\&#39;s just a bold new way that we can say &#34;We don\&#39;t fucking care.&#34; Go &#39;
 &#39;Redskins! &#39;,
 &#39;Goooood morning, guys!&#39;,
 &#39;We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our &#39;
 &#34;company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that&#39;s theh deadline!&#34;,
 &#34; What the hell? Can&#39;t find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where &#34;
 &#39;is kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how &#39;
 &#39;much our company is worth!&#39;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#39;Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird &#39;
 &#39;little Jewy guy! Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;You song of a bitch!&#39;,
 &#39;You broke Kickstarter!&#39;,
 &#34;Nobody can! It&#39;s gone! You just couldn&#39;t take it that our company was more &#34;
 &#39;successful than yours would ever be!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, somebody did!&#39;,
 &#34; A merger?! It&#39;s too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;have a company! We don&#39;t have anything! &#34;,
 &#39; It is really sweet.&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay &#39;
 &#39;relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington &#39;
 &#39;Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.&#39;,
 &#39;You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is &#39;
 &#39;the biggest &#34;fuck you&#34; we have ever come up with. But we didn\&#39;t stop there, &#39;
 &#39;because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved &#39;
 &#39;logo. &#39;,
 &#39;I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, whoa! What?&#39;,
 &#39; I guess we gotta go back to school. &#39;,
 &#34;How&#39;s it going, everybody?&#34;,
 &#39;Hey dude. Sup? &#39;,
 &#34;What do you mean? We&#39;re just... going to school.&#34;,
 &#39;Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, people are pissed off at us&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?&#39;,
 &#34;You know what we gotta do, guys?  We&#39;ve gotta throw a big fuckin&#39; party&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite &#39;
 &#34;everyone and then everyone thinks you&#39;re cool!&#34;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;m down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, &#34;
 &#34;and these assholes won&#39;t even remember us being dicks to them.&#34;,
 &#34;Right, it&#39;s gotta be an awesome party for...&#34;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;We lure people in with a cause and then hit &#39;em over the head with the best &#34;
 &#34;party ever. We&#39;re gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh my God, we&#39;ve got Lorde to play live&#34;,
 &#39;So who do we throw the party for?&#39;,
 &#39;You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a &#39;
 &#39;good time.&#39;,
 &#39;You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott &#39;
 &#39;Malkinson.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;I actually have plans this weekend. I\&#39;m Scott Malkinson. I\&#39;ve got &#39;
 &#39;diabetes.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Believe it, dude.&#39;,
 &#39;What the hell is gluten?&#39;,
 &#34;KYLE! IT&#39;S ALL GONE! THEY&#39;VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! &#34;
 &#39;KYLE!&#39;,
 &#34;THERE&#39;S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE &#34;
 &#34;CAKE AND WE&#39;RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!&#34;,
 &#39;KYYYLE!&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party&#39;s gonna suck.&#34;,
 &#34;What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;got is Lorde.&#39;,
 &#34;You know what I&#39;mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt &#34;
 &#34;Jemima. She&#39;s trying to tell me something. But then she just fades awway.&#34;,
 &#34; There&#39;s nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;gonna get better, they&#39;re gonna get worse.&#34;,
 &#39;Aunt Jemima. &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know the way, Aunt Jemima.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t even know what that means.&#34;,
 &#39;Are you going to eat those pancakes?&#39;,
 &#34;Nooo, it can&#39;t beee.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;ve got what backward? &#34;,
 &#39; Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.&#39;,
 &#39;KYYYLE!&#39;,
 &#39;KYYYLW, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMIMA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE &#39;
 &#39;PYRAMIDS!&#39;,
 &#34;My name isn&#39;t important. What matters is that... the answer is in the &#34;
 &#39;pyramid.&#39;,
 &#39;What, what is it? What is it for?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s upside down.&#34;,
 &#39;Sir, the pyramid is upside down.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah well, I&#39;m glad people aren&#39;t mad at you anymore. I know what that feels &#34;
 &#39;like.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. &#39;,
 &#39; Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the &#39;
 &#39;run-down schoo. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I &#39;
 &#34;should&#39;ve done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front &#34;
 &#34;pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I&#39;mm prepared for this, but still I &#34;
 &#39;wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! &#39;,
 &#34; Yeah I&#39;m good. How are you, Kyle?  They&#39;re all gonna pay! Every day they &#34;
 &#34;pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it&#39;s going to be the &#34;
 &#34;last time.  We&#39;ll find out today at recess, won&#39;t we? Oh yes, we&#39;ll find out &#34;
 &#39;today at recess.&#39;,
 &#39;Good for you. &#39;,
 &#34;No! Goddamnit no!  Who&#39;s takin&#39; a shit?!&#34;,
 &#39;I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!&#39;,
 &#39;Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my &#39;
 &#39;toilet time!&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, that does it!  I&#39;m sick of this shit and I&#39;m not gonna be  taking &#34;
 &#39;it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going to the potty.&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I&#39;m gransginger.&#34;,
 &#34;Did you notice the bow?  I&#39;m not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at &#34;
 &#34;birth, so I&#39;m exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. &#34;
 &#39;Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is &#34;
 &#39;nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, this is awesome. I should&#39;ve used the girls bathroom a long time ago.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I&#39;m a domb chick too. &#34;,
 &#34;Because I&#39;m transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls &#34;
 &#39;shitter.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society &#39;
 &#34;sees me as a boy but I&#39;m really a girl.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to &#34;
 &#34;do with the ginger I&#39;m attracted to. Check the state bylaws.&#34;,
 &#39;Erica.&#39;,
 &#34;All I know is I&#39;m transginger, and you can&#39;t make me go to the bathroom with &#34;
 &#39;the cisgingers.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.&#34;,
 &#34;Oho my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I&#39;m different, but you can just &#34;
 &#39;suck my clit AND my balls.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That&#39;s what.  Suck &#34;
 &#39;my clit and balls.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the &#34;
 &#39;problem. &#39;,
 &#39;Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?&#39;,
 &#39;OH MY GOD!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of couse, being forced into &#39;
 &#39;my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to &#39;
 &#39;approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah sooo I&#39;m thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of &#34;
 &#39;running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh on that side?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh I like that. That&#39;s gonna look nice, yeah.&#34;,
 &#39; It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move &#39;
 &#39;aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! &#39;
 &#34;Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you&#39;re gonna take &#34;
 &#34;it. You&#39;re all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;gonna open wide.  You&#39;re gonna TAKE your punishment! That&#39;s right! Get &#34;
 &#34;ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It&#39;s just like at home!&#34;,
 &#39;Yup! You know what Hillary says: &#34;You can suck my clit and balls.&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, this is my fuckin&#39; bathroom!&#34;,
 &#39;I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!&#39;,
 &#39;Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!&#39;,
 &#34;Because I don&#39;t want a chick watching me go poo!&#34;,
 &#34;No! I identify as a chick, but I&#39;m sill a boy. You can&#39;t make me share a &#34;
 &#39;bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY &#39;
 &#39;waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!&#39;,
 &#39; Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!&#39;,
 &#34;Do you know your girlfriend&#39;s going around tellin&#39; everyone that you&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;gay?!  Oh yeah! She&#39;s got the whole school believin&#39; that she&#39;s attracted to &#34;
 &#34;girls, but she&#39;s dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! &#34;
 &#34;Stan-an&#39;s a gir-rl! You&#39;d better curb your dog, Stan! You&#39;d better curb your &#34;
 &#39;dog before people start ripping on you! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damnit!&#39;,
 &#34;Why don&#39;t we just have everyone use the transgenger bathroom?!&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s cicginger! He&#39;s so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, here he comes, everyone! It&#39;s the cicginger! Think you can harass &#34;
 &#39;transgingers and use their bathroom?!&#39;,
 &#34;At this school, it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re trans or you&#39;re cis, right &#34;
 &#39;guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You &#39;
 &#39;know what we call those? Cissies!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It&#39;s gonna be all &#34;
 &#39;crowded. &#39;,
 &#39; Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?&#39;,
 &#34; Oh goddamnit, nobody&#39;s doing anything kewl!  I&#39;m so bored! Everything is so &#34;
 &#39;stupid!&#39;,
 &#34;No it isn&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s stupid.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m dying of boredom.&#34;,
 &#39; What did you say???&#39;,
 &#39;Your dad has a fucking drone???&#39;,
 &#39;Whooaa! &#39;,
 &#39; You wanna take it out for a spin?&#39;,
 &#39; Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy &#39;
 &#39;on everyone!&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, that&#39;s all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes &#34;
 &#39;tonight, your dad will never know.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, good idea.  We&#39;ll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t tell anyone!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh shit, it&#39;s your dad! Go go go!  I&#39;ll see you later at my house.&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, is that you?&#39;,
 &#34; Nobody followed you, right? You didn&#39;t tell anybody?!&#34;,
 &#34;Alright, come in.  Kenny&#39;s here; I told him all about it. &#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just Kenny. Like we&#39;re not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! &#34;
 &#39;Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured &#39;
 &#39;out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, look! There&#39;s everyone&#39;s backyards!  Dude there&#39;s Craig&#39;s house! &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s Craig&#39;s house!&#34;,

 &#39;Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word &#39;

 &#39;Not a word, Kenny!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;You guys wanna see Craig&#39;s mom&#39;s bush?&#34;,
 &#34;Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig&#39;s mom and they got pictures of her &#34;
 &#34;bush, and it&#39;s like, it&#39;s like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? &#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t wanna see Craig&#39;s mom&#39;s bush.&#34;,
 &#39; Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it &#39;

 &#39;Butters. Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!&#39;,
 &#39;Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my &#39;
 &#39;pbone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then &#39;
 &#39;anyone could have done it!&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, don&#39;t start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are &#34;
 &#34;just as reponsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;covering your ass! &#39;,
 &#39;What? &#39;,
 &#39;What does that have to do with me?&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny has no idea what you&#39;re talking about, dude.&#34;,
 &#39;You were what?!&#39;,
 &#39;You were spying on me?!&#39;,
 &#34;But you didn&#39;t say anything?! That&#39;s fucking spying, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#34;You were listening, but we didn&#39;t know you were there?! How is that not &#34;
 &#34;spying?! You&#39;r a dick! You&#39;re a spying dick! Abd now you wanna lecture Kenny &#34;
 &#39;about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! &#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Because, Butters-&#39;,
 &#39; Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and &#39;
 &#34;he knows that we put the video of Craig&#39;s mom on the Internet. He found out &#34;
 &#34;everything. That&#39;s why I had to make another video.&#34;,
 &#39;Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can way we were &#39;
 &#39;talking about THIS video. &#34;Ohh, thank you Eric, that\&#39;s pretty smart. I &#39;
 &#39;really owe you one.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It&#39;s... It&#39; just &#34;
 &#34;gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they&#39;re public domain. You can get on the &#34;
 &#34;Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games&#39; butthole. We &#34;
 &#39;can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because &#39;
 &#34;honestly, I&#39;m getting a little sick of covering your ass!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh hey Butters. Sup?&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, what&#39;s the matter?&#34;,
 &#34;Okay okay okay. Come inside, there&#39;s drones out here. &#34;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#39; Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we &#39;
 &#39;can get rid of all the drones.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it&#39;s just that everyone is waiting for everyone &#34;
 &#34;else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We&#39;re just gonna need one &#34;
 &#39;thing.&#39;,
 &#34;Your dad&#39;s drone.&#34;,
 &#34;Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s butthole didn&#39;t take picture &#34;
 &#39;of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you &#39;
 &#34;spying on birds! Now I&#39;m willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s the last time! Okay?!&#34;,
 &#34; Alright, we&#39;ve got power. Prepare for takeoff.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;ll work, Butters. If there&#39;s one thing we&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that drones &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t resist Craig&#39;s mom. &#34;,
 &#39;Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  &#34;Oh, thank you Eric. I &#39;
 &#34;screwed up everything but now everyone&#39;s happy. Thanks for covering my &#34;
 &#39;ass.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig&#39;s mom happy.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re welcome. &#34;,
 &#39; What are you two boners doing?&#39;,
 &#34;I played that thing; it&#39;s fuckin&#39; dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.&#34;,
 &#39;How much money did you micropay today, Stan?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.&#39;,
 &#39;Jimmy told me about this game.&#39;,
 &#39;The??&#39;,
 &#39;Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not a fabulous app! It&#39;s fuckin&#39; stupid!&#34;,
 &#39;How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give &#39;
 &#34;away a little taste and then... and then some people... can&#39;t stop &#34;
 &#39;themselves.&#39;,
 &#34; And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you&#39;ve been pushing that he can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!&#39;,
 &#39;That makes sense.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s done. &#34;,
 &#39;The word is out.  &#34;Terrand &amp; Phillip hire pushers to make money off &#39;
 &#39;addicts.&#34; I tweeted it.  It\&#39;s trending.&#39;,
 &#39;Cool.&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital &#34;
 &#39;signs are looking good. What do you see now? &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, they haven&#39;t worked out the audio yet, but I-  He&#39;s so fucking &#34;
 &#34;stupid.  But I&#39;m sure they will soon.&#34;,
 &#39; Butters, no! Are you crazy?!&#39;,
 &#34;What did I tell you about removing the headset when you&#39;re not back in the &#34;
 &#39;access hub??&#39;,
 &#39;You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if &#39;
 &#39;you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!&#39;,
 &#39;You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??&#39;,
 &#39;You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You &#39;
 &#39;have to hurry!&#39;,
 &#39;Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! &#39;
 &#34;We&#39;re just gonna make it!&#34;,
 &#39;Welcome back, dude.&#39;,
 &#39;How do you feel? Do you feel okay?&#39;,
 &#39;And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Whoa, I\&#39;m bkac.&#34;  Damnit if it\&#39;s not the aewsomeest thing ever!&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters&#39; torture!&#34;,
 &#39;Thank you, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a &#39;
 &#39;while, okay?!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won&#39;t happen again.&#34;,
 &#39;Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;See? He&#39;s an asshole. Fuck him.&#34;,
 &#39;Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. &#39;
 &#39;Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?&#39;,
 &#39;Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. &#39;,
 &#34; Okay, Butters, I&#39;m booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework &#34;
 &#39;is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?&#39;,
 &#39; Digital malcontent now at parameter slpha. Prepare for full graphic &#39;
 &#39;interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,  Mark. &#39;,
 &#39;All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and &#39;
 &#39;head outside.&#39;,
 &#34;Everything looks good, Butters. You&#39;re doing great. Let&#39;s get to work.&#34;,
 &#34; You&#39;re doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you &#34;
 &#39;clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. &#39;
 &#39;This is the part where you collect the money.&#39;,
 &#39;Just take the money, Butters! &#39;,
 &#39;You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscilaating. You need to uh, come &#39;
 &#39;back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should &#39;
 &#34;be heading back to the access point now. You&#39;re going off grid.&#34;,
 &#39; Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, it&#39;s uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh shit!  Butters/ Butters, where are you now?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay Butters, let&#39;s call it good, okay?&#34;,
 &#39;Wait, hang on Butters!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters?? Butters?? &#39;,
 &#39;Butters. &#39;,
 &#39;Are you okay?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not here, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;This is going to be hard to undersstand, Butters,  but, you&#39;ve become &#34;
 &#39;trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headet off outside the access &#39;
 &#34;point, didn&#39;t I?! We&#39;re actually both in my house right now. You&#39;re wearing &#34;
 &#34;the headset and I&#39;m talking toyou as a computer program. That&#39;s why I can... &#34;
 &#39;manipulate reality. &#39;,
 &#34;You see, in this world, things aren&#39;t... what they seam. &#34;,
 &#39;Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. &#39;
 &#34;You can&#39;t trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the &#34;
 &#39;Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.&#39;,
 &#39; How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? &#39;,
 &#39;Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ve gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! &#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m happy that I totally got away with it.  What&#39;s a 911 area code?  Hello?&#34;,
 &#39;With what?&#39;,
 &#39; Fuck you!&#39;,
 &#34;Uh huh. &#39;Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I&#39;m actually the &#34;
 &#39;one trapped in virtual reality.&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, tell him you&#39;re not computer programs.&#34;,
 &#34; Kyle, just- don&#39;t be a dick right now.&#34;,
 &#34;Do you really think I&#39;m that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along &#34;
 &#39;has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! &#39;,
 &#39;Are you fucking with me?!&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, I&#39;m seriously! Are you fucking with me?!&#34;,
 &#34;Because if you are, it&#39;s not cool!&#34;,
 &#34;Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I&#39;m the one &#34;
 &#34;who&#39;s wearing a headset and has forgetten he&#39;s in virtual reality!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh it&#39;s a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I&#39;m the one trapped in &#34;
 &#34;virtual reality, that means you&#39;re nothing but a computer program!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right!&#34;,
 &#34;THAT&#39;S RIGHT! And you&#39;d better stop messin&#39; around, Butters, so I can help &#34;
 &#39;you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality &#39;
 &#39;you die in real life?&#39;,
 &#39;Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life &#39;
 &#39;too! For EVER! &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s okay. Everything is cool. Don&#39;t let anyone mess with your head, and &#34;
 &#34;it&#39;s all going to be fine. You&#39;re cool, Eric. You&#39;re cool. &#34;,
 &#34;I know. Let&#39;s go to the backyard. &#34;,
 &#39;Okay Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39; Mmmhmm.&#39;,
 &#39;And why did the guys send you, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extrenely hard to &#39;
 &#39;believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.&#39;,
 &#34;I know it&#39;s hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service &#34;
 &#34;to try and convince you that none of what you&#39;ve seen is real. You bought &#34;
 &#39;the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Calm down.&#39;,
 &#39;In virtual reality, yes you did.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ve been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!&#39;,
 &#39; Fuck!&#39;,
 &#39;Or if I did?&#39;,
 &#39;What?  Hello?&#39;,
 &#39;Dude. NOW this is getting weird!&#39;,
 &#39; No, you guys. This is virtual reality.&#39;,
 &#34;Because... I&#39;m a computer program.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer &#34;
 &#34;program. I&#39;m not real.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.&#34;,
 &#39;You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. &#39;
 &#39;The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing &#39;
 &#34;all this, and it&#39;s not me!&#34;,
 &#39;Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. &#39;,
 &#34; What&#39;s this?&#34;,
 &#34; Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we&#39;re actually busy&#34;,
 &#34;Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can&#39;t expect &#34;
 &#39;people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah so, sorry you&#39;re not getting any spectators, but there&#39;s hardcore dude &#34;
 &#39;shit to watch.&#39;,
 &#39;This asshole needs to make a move already!&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s playing an enchantment.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, it was complete brotality!&#39;,
 &#39;At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an &#39;
 &#39;instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, I don&#39;t think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was &#34;
 &#39;almost repulsive!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we&#39;re fuckin&#39; dudes, bro.&#34;,
 &#39; Kewwwl!&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s hardcore and exciting about City shrinp? &#34;,
 &#39;Dude, do we look like police?&#39;,
 &#39;Five darrar? &#39;,
 &#39;Dude, that was total carnage!&#39;,
 &#39;Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana &#39;
 &#39;tapped?&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re going again on Friday, right?&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the matter Kenny?&#34;,
 &#39;You feel bad for the roosters?&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, I think maybe Kenny&#39;s a little hurt because he was the big Magic &#34;
 &#39;champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh? A little bit?&#39;,
 &#39;What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, &#39;
 &#34;where&#39;s that smile? Where&#39;s that smile, Kenny? I think he&#39;s smiling you &#34;
 &#39;guys. &#39;,
 &#39;Hello? We\&#39;re looking to buy a rooster that can play &#34;Magic: The Gathering&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any &#39;
 &#39;free-range chickens?&#39;,
 &#39;Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?&#39;,
 &#39;What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about &#34;McNuggets&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39; &#34;Yes I do, you guys.&#34;  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?&#39;,
 &#39;All right McNuggets!&#39;,
 &#39; That was goddamned manly! I mean, noo offense to Kenny, but that shit made &#39;
 &#39;regular &#34;Magic: The Gathering&#34; look like girls vollyball.&#39;,
 &#39;Thank you so very much.&#39;,
 &#34;You hear that, McNuggets? You&#39;re goin&#39; to the big leagues!&#34;,
 &#34;We can&#39;t tell you, bro. It&#39;s like, hardcore undreground shit.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.&#39;,
 &#39;OOHHH!! &#39;,

 &#34;Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You&#39;re reached the big time. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we&#39;re here for the cock Magic.&#34;,

 &#34;This isn&#39;t even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.&#34;,
 &#39;Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!&#39;,
 &#39;Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will &#39;
 &#39;have a +1 attack.&#39;,
 &#39;Dude, he just cast Psochogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has &#39;
 &#39;to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.&#39;,
 &#34;Did you hear that? He&#39;s shuffling his deck already. The only thing he&#39;s got &#34;
 &#39;on the battle ground now is an overseer.&#39;,
 &#34;Ah, dude, your dad&#39;s here.&#34;,
 &#39;It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. &#39;
 &#39;It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan&#39;s dad shot his dick off. I just, I &#34;
 &#34;seriously don&#39;t know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?&#34;,
 &#34;He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it&#39;s lame how?&#34;,

 &#34;I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I&#39;m going to need your &#34;
 &#39;underwear. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?&#39;,
 &#39;You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all &#39;
 &#34;means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I&#39;m not going to accept four &#34;
 &#34;days of detention and... you&#39;re going tapologize publicly for being so &#34;
 &#39;strict to me and my friends at school.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just a request, that&#39;s all. See you around.  Oh, you seem to have &#34;
 &#34;dropped something, PC Principal.  What&#39;s this? Why, this is a little boy&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;underwear.  Why, this is Butters&#39; underwear.&#34;,
 &#34;PC Principal, you have Butters&#39; underwear and now...  Oh my gosh, it&#39;s got &#34;
 &#34;your DNA all over it.  This certainly doesn&#39;t look good for you. I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. &#39;
 &#39;Capisce?&#39;,
 &#39;You ean about keeping your dick out?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh-kay. Look, you don&#39;t want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so &#34;
 &#39;you?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, let&#39;s back up.  Aaah!&#34;,
 &#34; No, I&#39;m sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh God!&#39;,
 &#34; We can&#39;t beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.&#34;,
 &#34;There&#39;s nothingn left to do. I&#39;m going to admit I did something wrong, take &#34;
 &#34;my punishment, and move on. I&#39;m not Tom Brady.&#34;,
 &#39;No way.&#39;,
 &#34;Pecause PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it&#39;s time for &#34;
 &#39;us to grow up.&#39;,
 &#34;If I can face my prejudice, why can&#39;t you? We&#39;re two privileged, straight &#34;
 &#39;white boys who have their laughs about things we hever had to deal with.&#39;,
 &#34; Aaahh, aahh!  Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;amake ourselves better people... together. &#39;,
 &#34;No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let&#39;s start a new chapter.&#34;,
 &#34;No. I&#39;m going to call you... my friend.&#34;,
 &#39;I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.&#39;,
 &#39;Ack! Butters!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh Butters, I&#39;ve lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want &#34;
 &#39;and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the &#34;
 &#39;world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.&#39;,
 &#34;OH. Eh, oh it&#39;s no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making &#34;
 &#39;positive changes, but I... cam barely even walk.  How is everybody doing?&#39;,
 &#39;Who?&#39;,
 &#39; ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.&#34;,
 &#34;I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don&#39;t agree with his hateful, &#34;
 &#34;bigoted thoughts. Kyle&#39;s view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn &#34;
 &#34;Jenner&#39;s a stunning hero,  but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll stand by while Kyle&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;intolerance is dealt with violently. We&#39;re going to war with these PC people &#34;
 &#34;once and for all! Butters, I&#39;m going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and &#34;
 &#39;some taco launchers.&#39;,
 &#39;All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! &#39;,
 &#39;Fire the taco launchers!  Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! &#39;,
 &#39; The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! &#39;,
 &#39;All right, good. The pregnant Mesican women are falling asleep on the &#39;
 &#39;tacos.  All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their &#39;
 &#39;children! &#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s still too many PC guys on the balcony and- oh.  Oh fuck, there&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;Kyle.  What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can &#39;
 &#34;actually be important, because it starts a dialogue.  What&#39;s wrong, Kyle? &#34;
 &#39;You have your cake. Eat it, too.&#39;,
 &#34;Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.&#39;,
 &#39;Think about what heppened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle &#39;
 &#39;gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch &#39;
 &#34;of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle&#39;s brother is Canadian. What if &#34;
 &#39;Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?&#39;,
 &#34;And he&#39;s sitting right here.&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis 34?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, it&#39;s intriguing, because in Genesis 34, the Jews actually did &#34;
 &#39;somethiing similar to what Kyle is doing now.&#39;,
 &#34;But it&#39;s happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech &#34;
 &#39;about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of &#39;
 &#34;America. &#39;Cause you&#39;re a Jew.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m out.&#34;,
 &#39;Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canandians &#39;
 &#39;here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next &#39;
 &#34;thing you know, they&#39;re sending us to camps and using us as livestock!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re gonna need a symbolic union.&#34;,
 &#34;You know, what&#39;s that story about two sides that were fighting and, then a &#34;
 &#39;guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of &#39;
 &#39;brought the groups together?&#39;,
 &#39; Yes, Lion King II?. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of &#39;
 &#39;them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting &#39;
 &#39;along.&#39;,
 &#39;Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now?  Is he SERIOUSLY &#39;
 &#39;giving a speech right now?!  This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so &#39;
 &#34;whoever&#39;s gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.&#34;,
 &#34;What about that one? In the glasses? She&#39;s kinda hot.&#34;,
 &#39;All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in &#39;
 &#39;the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. Do you just want a race war?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, go fuck thw one in the white shoes.&#39;,
 &#39;And start a pride all of our own.&#39;,
 &#39;Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?&#39;,
 &#34;Butters, we don&#39;t have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the &#34;
 &#39;chase with a Hot Cosby!&#39;,
 &#39;Nobody cares about 40 years from now when she suddenly chanages her mind, &#39;
 &#34;Butters?! Time is of the essense! We&#39;re all gonna die! &#34;,
 &#39;Dude!&#39;,
 &#34;Because apparently he doesn&#39;t care that his jokes are at the expense of &#34;
 &#39;actual people.&#39;,
 &#34;No.  Hey, we are not country bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny&#39;s a bumpkin!&#34;,
 &#34;We don&#39;t have junk cars in our yards, that&#39;s just your family, Kenny! &#34;,
 &#39;Are the Mexicans actually staying?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, I just didn&#39;t want you caught off-guard.  I was thinking of giving &#34;
 &#39;this place 5 stars.&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, but I&#39;m kind of teetering on 5 stars orrr 1 star.&#34;,
 &#39;Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.&#39;,
 &#39;Great, and can you turn down the music a bit?  This pagan shit hurts my &#39;
 &#39;ears.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor.  Busboy!&#39;,
 &#39;Ehexcuse me?&#39;,
 &#39;Uhh, it\&#39;s actually pronounced &#34;David,&#34; okay?&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s &#34;David,&#34; dude. Look it up.&#39;,
 &#39;Mmmhmmm! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh God, now everyone thinks they&#39;re a food critic.&#34;,
 &#39; Here you go. &#39;,
 &#39;Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.&#34;,
 &#34;EEWW.  What&#39;s the busboy doing here?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to &#39;
 &#39;school?  Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;Look amigo, I&#39;m sorry I only gave your parents&#39; restaurant two stars, but it &#34;
 &#39;could have been worse.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but the food totally mesed my stomach up. The morning after I ate &#34;
 &#39;it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.&#39;,
 &#39;It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It &#39;
 &#34;was like being raped from the inside. Your parents&#39; restaurant just wasn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;up to my standards, David.&#39;,
 &#39;David.&#39;,
 &#39;David.&#39;,
 &#39;David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two &#39;
 &#39;seconds, dude.  ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.&#39;,
 &#34;Uhuh, I&#39;m a food critic, Butters, okay? I can&#39;t just eat cafeteria food.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, you ar a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only  one star late.&#39;,
 &#39;Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, no no, you you&#39;re right, Kyle. I&#39;m not important. Oh, hey David, I was &#34;
 &#39;just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny &#39;
 &#39;bicicleta? Eh?&#39;,
 &#39;What? I just want to hear him say &#34;Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to &#39;
 &#39;schooool.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s awesome!  I&#39;m gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, &#34;
 &#39;David. Thanks. &#39;,
 &#39;Hm hm hm the fuck?  Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor!  Hey &#39;
 &#39;David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? &#39;
 &#34;David.  Over here, there&#39;s some shit on the floor.  Heyheyhey hey! What&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;goin&#39; on, man?&#34;,
 &#34;What are you talking about? I&#39;m the most influential critic in this town. &#34;
 &#39;Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little &#34;My name is David. Me &#39;
 &#39;ride me biciceta to schoool&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; Okay, I&#39;m uh I&#39;m updating my review. I&#39;m about to do it.  You&#39;d better &#34;
 &#39;start riding a bicicleta to school!  One star! ... No s-no stars?  No stars? &#39;
 &#34;... You can&#39;t just treat me like I&#39;m nothing... I still know I&#39;m worth &#34;
 &#34;something! Come on, guys!  Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that&#39;s good. &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s good. &#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s all over, Butters. Everything I&#39;ve worked so hard to achieve. All &#34;
 &#39;these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.&#39;,
 &#34;All these people trying to be like me. And they don&#39;t even write about poop &#34;
 &#39;consistency the next day.&#39;,
 &#39;I guess.&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to &#34;
 &#39;make... real food critics respected again.&#39;,
 &#34;Not a part, Mom. I&#39;ve invaited all the poser food critics over for a &#34;
 &#39;meeting.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not fun, it&#39;s serious. These people think they can do what I do, but &#34;
 &#39;they need to be, but they need to be made to understand the reality. When &#39;
 &#34;the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay?  Okay, that&#39;s them, &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s them. Go, get lost, Mom! &#34;,
 &#39;Fuck!  Mom!&#39;,
 &#34;But Mom, there&#39;s like a billion people here.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, there&#39;s a fucking billion people here!  Uh, thank you all for coming. &#34;
 &#39;My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.&#39;,
 &#34;Now, you see, the problem is that when there&#39;s too many reviewers, people no &#34;
 &#34;longer know who is the real food critic.  It&#39;s great that you all want to be &#34;
 &#39;critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can &#39;
 &#39;just follow. And with this many people all following  one captain, we can &#39;
 &#39;fight to get our power back! &#39;,
 &#39;So now rise up, and  fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the &#39;
 &#39;restaurants that our food critic does matter!&#39;,
 &#34; It didn&#39;t do well with Yelpers.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.&#39;,
 &#34;Look, I&#39;m sorry goys, but Whistlin&#39; Willy&#39;s failed to recognize the &#34;
 &#39;influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one &#39;
 &#39;question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to &#39;
 &#39;school?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m done! I&#39;m now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on &#34;
 &#34;my every word!  And I&#39;m gonna use my power to finally get what this town &#34;
 &#39;really needs.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, hello David! &#39;,
 &#39;...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! &#39;
 &#34;Right, guys? Maybe I don&#39;t deserve special treatment, but how else can I be &#34;
 &#39;the elite food critic they want? &#39;,
 &#34;Why thank you, David. That&#39;s good service.&#34;,
 &#39;Mmmm, is that a jalapeño cream sauce?&#39;,
 &#34;Hmmm. It&#39;s tart, but savory.&#34;,
 &#39; Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up &#39;
 &#39;on me and said I was fat.&#39;,
 &#39;I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by  &#39;
 &#39;Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I &#39;
 &#39;asked one of the kids  if he would take a picture of me  and he did. And I &#39;
 &#39;looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put &#39;
 &#39;the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in &#34;Don\&#39;t I look ripped?&#34; and &#39;
 &#39;I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments &#39;
 &#34;on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn&#39;t ripped, and &#34;
 &#34;they said that I was fat and I didn&#39;t have muscles. The Internet made fun of &#34;
 &#39;me and &#39;,
 &#34;I said you were perfect because you&#39;re really good at getting all your &#34;
 &#34;schoolwork done on time  so you&#39;d probably do a really good job.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not a joke!&#34;,
 &#39;I wanted someone smart and hard-working!&#39;,
 &#39;There you are. You have my social media comments?&#39;,
 &#34; Mmmhm. Hmoh, that&#39;s nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great!  Oh Kyle! You &#39;
 &#39;thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? &#39;
 &#34;You should see all the comments I&#39;m getting. People are actually really &#34;
 &#39;stoked on me now.&#39;,
 &#39;Butters!&#39;,
 &#39; What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says &#39;
 &#39;&#34;This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;What new people? &#39;,
 &#34;Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She&#39;s fuckin&#39; hot, she&#39;s not being fat-shamed!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that?!&#39;,
 &#34;Everyone likes me and thinks I&#39;m great in my safe space.&#34;,
 &#34; People don&#39;t judge me and haters don&#39;t hate in my safe space? &#34;,
 &#39;Bully-proof windows.&#39;,
 &#39;People that support me.&#39;,
 &#39;More people that support me.&#39;,
 &#39;Bully-proof windows. &#39;,
 &#39;What? Who is that?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ll take care of him, Demi! &#34;,
 &#39;Our safe spaces will keep you out!&#39;,
 &#39;But Reality we can do without!&#39;,
 &#39;Bully-proof windows.&#39;,
 &#39;That was nice.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-&#34;  oh. Oh God. Oh, that\&#39;s &#39;
 &#39;te-horrible  Augh.  Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. &#34;I\&#39;d like to sitck my &#39;
 &#39;wiener into those fat rols of-&#34; Oh God!  Uh, delete! &#34;You aren\&#39;t fat, but &#39;
 &#39;my dick is-&#34; Whoa, God.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;pretty stoked on it.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, Tweek and Craig. It&#39;s just so weird. If they&#39;ve been gay this whole &#34;
 &#34;time, have they been checking me out? I&#39;m pretty sure Craig has seen my &#34;
 &#39;wiener. Should I kick his ass?&#39;,
 &#34;I just don&#39;t understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?&#34;,
 &#34;I guess, just because I don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t mean I shouldn&#39;t support &#34;
 &#39;it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don&#39;t let anyone see you.&#34;,
 &#39;Did you do it, Cupid-Me?&#39;,
 &#34;! That&#39;s awesome!! That&#39;s so sweet.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, dude. You&#39;re hilarious.&#34;,
 &#34; Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I&#39;m not homosexual, okay? It&#39;s not funny.&#34;,
 &#39;Yep. School tomorrow should be very interesting.&#39;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys, hurry!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s, It&#39;s Tweek and Craig, dude! They&#39;re about to have sex! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh God, you guys. Get a room. &#39;,
 &#39; &#34;Can\&#39;t we just try? Teehee.&#34; Oh maaan.&#39;,
 &#39;Someone who needs a real talking to.&#39;,
 &#34;Look, it&#39;s flattering, okay? But it doesn&#39;t change the fact that there&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;nothing here for you to keep pursuing.&#39;,
 &#34;You are wasting your time. I&#39;m not attracted to guys.&#34;,
 &#34;I realize that, but I&#39;m sorry. I need you to stop bothering me.  This... is &#34;
 &#34;done. I&#39;m just not a homosexual. &#34;,
 &#34;What are you doing? This place isn&#39;t you. &#34;,
 &#34;No I&#39;m not. I&#39;m here because we need you right now.&#34;,
 &#39;Fuck you.&#39;,
 &#39;The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not homosexual!&#34;,
 &#39;Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back &#39;
 &#39;together.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, hey, whoa, whoawhoawhoa. I&#39;m not here for me, I&#39;m here for my friend, &#34;
 &#39;okay? &#39;,
 &#34; Okay, okay, the date&#39;s almost over.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s fine. It just doesn&#39;t really do anything for me.&#34;,
 &#34;Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I&#39;m straight!&#34;,
 &#34;Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God!  Oh Cupid Me, that&#39;s enough! Okay, &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;s it, Cupid Me! That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s it, Cupid Me. Okay, that&#39;s it. &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s it, Cupid Me. &#34;,
 &#34;You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they&#39;re gay!  They&#39;re totally guy!&#34;,
 &#39;Kenny and Token.&#39;,
 &#34;Kenny and Token, dude. They&#39;re so gay. Butters told me.&#34;,
 &#34;No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny&#39;s house, Kenny and &#34;
 &#39;Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas &#39;
 &#39;in it trying to scare people away.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin&#39; dumb! Dude, come one! &#34;
 &#34;We&#39;ve gtta go see this!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh my God they&#39;re so gay you guys.&#34;,
 &#34;Ah, no, we&#39;re good, thanks.  Oh my God this is a sausage party!&#34;,
 &#34; Yeah, I&#39;m sure they are. &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s pretty cool.&#34;,
 &#39;Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don&#39;t think we should let &#34;
 &#34;Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He&#39;s probably gonna try and &#34;
 &#34;turn ir around on me, but that&#39;s &#39;cause Kyle knows I heard him.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, cool... Ir&#39;s me, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m just, I&#39;m just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes I do, Butters. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re pretty badass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can &#34;
 &#34;see it&#39;s really cool.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah yeah, and it&#39;s like, we can do whatever we want, and people are &#34;
 &#34;scared of us, it&#39;s totally rad!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God! I never said it was gay!&#39;,
 &#39;That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way &#39;
 &#34;Tweek and Craig make love?!  He&#39;s a lying, backstabbing Jew!&#34;,
 &#39;So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were &#39;
 &#39;playing basketball, remember?&#39;,
 &#39;And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas &#39;
 &#39;were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?&#39;,
 &#39;No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he &#39;
 &#34;doesn&#39;t wanna get kicked out of the group. That&#39;s what Jews do when they get &#34;
 &#39;caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Buttters.&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, dude.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re funkin&#39; ninjas, dude!&#34;,
 &#39;Ah, ecuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?&#39;,
 &#39;Should Jews be trusted?  Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that &#39;
 &#39;as being at all problematic?&#39;,
 &#39;YEEES!  YEEES!  Oh--oh, oh--oh! Oh--oh, oh--oh! What did I tell you guys?&#39;,
 &#39;You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must &#39;
 &#39;face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader &#39;
 &#39;overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me &#39;
 &#34;a lot I didn&#39;t know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. &#34;
 &#39;But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews &#39;
 &#34;cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle&#39;s house to talk to him about it, and I &#34;
 &#39;found this.  It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had &#39;
 &#39;brainwahsed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to &#39;
 &#34;refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That&#39;s when Kyle &#34;
 &#39;tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja.  Kyle knew I would never &#39;
 &#34;call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he&#39;s going to try and tell you &#34;
 &#34;that I&#39;m lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.&#34;,
 &#39; Who, who is this?&#39;,
 &#39;...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said &#39;
 &#39;ninjas were gay, bug Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I &#39;
 &#39;said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin&#39; gay but you &#34;
 &#34;didn&#39;t wanna listen, nooo!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh my fucking God...&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m so bored, dude.&#34;,
 &#39;I am not your slave, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Have fun, dude.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, and wasn&#39;t Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;putting this out?&#39;,
 &#34;How do you hate the Internet? That&#39;s like hating titties.&#34;,
 &#39;How does it do that?&#39;,
 &#34;That movie&#39;s gonna suck dude.&#34;,
 &#39;Eating ice cream, dipshit.&#39;,
 &#34;And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde&#39;s mom would &#34;
 &#34;have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;mom is dead. &#39;,
 &#34;Didn&#39;t we finish doing that?&#34;,
 &#34;Why isn&#39;t anyone looking at me?&#34;,
 &#34;Stan&#39;s calling you a traitor.&#34;,
 &#39;I am loving this right now.&#39;,
 &#34;Hohh that&#39;s low. &#34;,
 &#39;Fiiight! &#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?&#39;,
 &#39;So what do we do now?&#39;,
 &#39;Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get &#39;
 &#39;our hands on guns?&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey! Don&#39;t fall too hard, partner.  Do I look sweet, Butters?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, I just wanns finish this movie.&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, I&#39;m into this movie. I&#39;m not going to bed right now. Chillax.&#34;,
 &#39;I will go to bed  when this movie is over, Mom!&#39;,
 &#34;Turn off the light and go back to bed. I&#39;m staying up.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think so, Mom.&#34;,
 &#39;No means no, Bill Cosby!&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, Mom, what the hell?&#39;,
 &#39;Mom, put down the gun.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, I am going. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. &#34;,
 &#39;Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s a nice gun right there.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes, dude!&#39;,
 &#39; You wanted to see me, PC Principal?&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s &#34;skankhunt42&#34; and no I am not.&#39;,
 &#34;Unfortunatey, that&#39;d be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, &#34;
 &#34;nobody respected you girls&#39; poignant protest more than I did.&#34;,
 &#39;Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of skankhunt42 &#39;
 &#39;has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our &#39;
 &#39;school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students &#39;
 &#34;believe that it&#39;s just because girls don&#39;t have a sense of humor. I beg to &#34;
 &#39;disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in &#39;
 &#39;the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters &#39;
 &#39;sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize &#39;
 &#39;and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you &#39;
 &#39;come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wemdu Testaburger, guys.  Wendy, go &#39;
 &#34;ahead. Be funny.  Say something funny, Wendy. We can&#39;t wait.&#34;,
 &#34;Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women&#39;s comedy &#34;
 &#39;stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with &#39;
 &#39;guy and then say &#34;my vagina&#34; a lot.&#39;,
 &#34;And that&#39;s just the kind of sexist bullcrap that&#39;s gonna keep you in the &#34;
 &#34;kitchen. Sit your ass down.  This isn&#39;t a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. &#34;
 &#34;Bebe, why don&#39;t you come up here? Come on, Bebe.&#34;,
 &#39;No? Come on, talk about havin\&#39; sex with guys, and say &#34;vagina&#34; and stuff &#39;
 &#39;like that. Go ahead.  Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. &#39;
 &#39;Seriously.&#39;,
 &#34; Huh. Oh my God, that wasn&#39;t really all that funny. That&#39;s weird. Um, let&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly.&#39;,
 &#34;K, that wasn&#39;t really funny, it was just angry.&#34;,
 &#34;K, that&#39;s good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, &#34;my vagina.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; Hi guys!  Are you all ready to hear a story?&#39;,
 &#39;This was a book I created all with my imagination. It\&#39;s called &#34;Little Red &#39;
 &#39;Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four &#39;
 &#39;hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the &#39;
 &#39;forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was &#39;
 &#39;a little black boy named Token.&#34; Get over it. &#34;But then, a big bad wolf who &#39;
 &#34;was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said &#39;I have a &#34;
 &#39;large VAGINA\&#39; and traded place-&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet &#39;
 &#39;trolls.&#39;,
 &#39;Why would I do that, Kyle?&#39;,
 &#39; Help!  Help me! Augh! Aw! &#39;,
 &#39;A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to &#39;
 &#39;pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this &#39;
 &#39;vagina on my face!  They said it was to send a message!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah. See, here&#39;s the top of the vagina and there&#39;s the balls.  It&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?&#39;,
 &#34;What do you mean? If vaginas don&#39;t have balls, what do they have?&#34;,
 &#39; Hey broship. Got a minute?&#39;,
 &#39;You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool &#39;
 &#34;people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don&#39;t have &#34;
 &#39;balls.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I&#39;m doing. I know that a war is &#34;
 &#39;coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the &#39;
 &#39;National Anthem.&#39;,
 &#34;Suppose for one second that I&#39;m not skankhunt42. And that I really have been &#34;
 &#34;doing what I&#39;ve been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?&#34;,
 &#34;&#39;Cause I&#39;m scared, Kyle. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but race wars are &#34;
 &#39;back. And now if we get gender wars too??&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah but... you can&#39;t track down an Internet troll,  it&#39;s too bad.&#34;,
 &#39;Totally you guys. This has gone far enough. The girls are really pissed off &#39;
 &#39;at us. &#39;,
 &#39;You hear that, guys? It better not happen again tonight. I am SO seriously.&#39;,
 &#39;Sup dudes?&#39;,
 &#34; Are you serious?! All-night broship Counter Strike party?! That&#39;s fuckin&#39; &#34;
 &#34;sweet! Does you uncle&#39;s cabin have good wifi?&#34;,
 &#34;BROS! Dude, that&#39;s so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever! &#34;,
 &#39;This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter &#39;
 &#39;Strike all night. Alone in the woods. You pumped, Token?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m totally gonna do massiive pwnage. Whoever&#39;s on my team will will be &#34;
 &#34;stoked! My laptop&#39;s so fast it doesn&#39;t lag at all. I can jump around like a &#34;
 &#39;pwnage powerhouse.&#39;,
 &#39;You guys all seem kind of, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, cool. We&#39;re going a long way to play Counter Strike. Guess it&#39;s sweet &#34;
 &#34;though. There won&#39;t be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further &#34;
 &#39;now?&#39;,
 &#34;This place has sweet wifi, right? It&#39;s gonna be so awesome. &#34;,
 &#34;Oh dude, is this it? This is kewl. So isolated. Check it out: there&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, is this where we&#39;re gonna play?  I call dibs on this side.  What&#39;s the &#34;
 &#34;wifi called? Is there a password?  I don&#39;t set it. I don&#39;t see it comin&#39; up &#34;
 &#34;on my laptop. I don&#39;t know, I think maybe the wifi&#39;s not working. Where&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;the box? You&#39;ve gotta unplug it and plug it back in.  You guys?  You guys? &#34;
 &#34;There&#39;s... no wifi.&#34;,
 &#34;what are yugh... What are you guys talkin&#39; about?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh my God.  Oh my God you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can&#39;t get &#34;
 &#39;online.&#39;,
 &#34;Please! Please don&#39;t break my stuff, you guys. This is like two Christmases &#34;
 &#34;and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can&#39;t do this! PLEASE!&#34;,
 &#34;No don&#39;t take them from me! Don&#39;t break my stuff! I&#39;m not skankhunt! I&#39;m &#34;

 &#39;Heidi? Heidi Turner?&#39;,
 &#39;Where? &#39;,
 &#39;The park?&#39;,
 &#39; I miss my stuff.&#39;,
 &#39;For what?&#39;,
 &#34;You weren&#39;t the only one. I guess I didn&#39;t desreve a second chance. I really &#34;
 &#39;tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show &#39;
 &#39;that I was trying to llsten.&#39;,
 &#39; Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her &#39;
 &#34;vagina, I lose my fuckin&#39; mind.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t have any friends. I don&#39;t know if I ever did.&#34;,
 &#39;Kewl.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey.  I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And &#39;
 &#39;then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if &#39;
 &#34;African-Americans think they&#39;re funny.&#34;,
 &#39;Because, black laughs matter.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, it is.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, you do.  Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?&#39;,
 &#34;You wanna go somewhere? I&#39;ll follow you. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah. It&#39;s the best, dude. Try it.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?&#39;,
 &#39;Do girls... not have balls?&#39;,
 &#34;So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work?  I just don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;understand what&#39;s at the bottom of a vagina.&#34;,
 &#39;...Holy shiiit.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Kewl. That&#39;s kewl.&#34;,
 &#39;I saw a vagina, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not holding a grudge. I&#39;m happier now. I have purpose.&#34;,
 &#34;My girlfriend&#39;s. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast, but in &#34;
 &#39;that instant you know what I saw? I saw that humandkind could colonize Mars. &#39;
 &#39;I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and, reach the &#39;
 &#39;infinite.&#39;,
 &#34;Of course you did, &#39;cause you&#39;re amazing. And look what I made you. &#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s what my baby wanted.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, sorry. Heidi, you know... Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Either way we totally can. I just-I guess Kyle has something to talk to &#39;
 &#39;us about first, um? Go ahead, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;He said something about us working together to help take down Butters?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not sure, boo. Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? Heidi&#39;s amazing &#34;
 &#39;at figuring stuff out. &#39;,
 &#34;You wanna know what&#39;s really going on? I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s going on. Even &#34;
 &#34;thogh woomen have made great gains in the last century, they&#39;re still a part &#34;
 &#34;of men who aren&#39;t comfortable with women having power. It really just comes &#34;
 &#39;down to that. And then you have social media which allows men to anonymously &#39;
 &#39;say horrif thins like &#34;women aren\&#39;t funny&#34; even thoguh Heidi\&#39;s like the &#39;
 &#39;funniest person I ever met.&#39;,
 &#34;No, it&#39;s true. Get over yourself.&#34;,
 &#34;I know. You don&#39;t have to, &#39;cause you&#39;re awesome.&#34;,
 &#39;Like mess with Butters how? What do you mean &#34;mess with Butters&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, I see. You have a problem with Heidi.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say &#34;
 &#34;and she&#39;s funnier than you!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, she&#39;s not funnier than you?! Or is she just not funny because she&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;girl?!&#39;,
 &#39;Sorry baby, it just really ruffles my feathers.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re kind, we&#39;re just out of it now.&#34;,
 &#39;Humans, on Mars. &#39;,
 &#34; Hey hey, whoa, guys, guys!  Come on, hasn&#39;t this gone long enough? Aren&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;we tired of being so divided at skewl?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s cool, baby. &#34;,
 &#39;Heidi has really been hurt by all of this, you guys, and I think, for her &#39;
 &#34;sake, it&#39;s time for us to all try and come together. As a skewl!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey you guys?&#39;,
 &#34;Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don&#39;t know if many of &#34;
 &#34;you know Heidi but she&#39;s really smart and really funny.&#34;,
 &#34;You are. And she&#39;s come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell &#39;em, baby.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?&#39;,
 &#39;Remember, you were like &#34;Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?&#34; in uh, what was &#39;
 &#39;it?  Remember, you- it was like uh-&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, &#39;
 &#39;what was it&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah yeah yeah, that&#39;s when you said that- don&#39;t let anybody-  Oh hey guys. &#34;
 &#34;Wha-what&#39;s up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we&#39;ll be going to &#34;
 &#39;each individual class with more information. And after that...&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s awesome. You&#39;re doing awesome.&#34;,
 &#39;We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that&#39;,
 &#39;Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride. No more fighting, &#39;
 &#34;it&#39;s time for something new.&#34;,
 &#39;And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.&#39;,
 &#39;Terraform Mars.&#39;,
 &#39;It was a great idea.  Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;Heidi! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t say that.&#34;,
 &#34;Because you&#39;re smart and funny, that&#39;s why. It was a great idea, Heidi.  I &#34;
 &#39;think that someehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone &#39;
 &#39;even realizes.&#39;,
 &#34;People of Denmark, we know that you&#39;ve been the victim of trolling. So have &#34;
 &#34;we. Maybe we can help. I&#39;m not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... &#34;
 &#34;She&#39;s really smart and really funny.&#34;,
 &#39; You are, babe. Stop it.&#39;,
 &#39; Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.&#39;,
 &#39;Kewl!  Hi!  So keewl.  Hi.  Dude, Mars rules. Mars rules. &#39;,
 &#34;Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren&#39;t so &#34;
 &#39;closed-minded.&#39;,
 &#34; He&#39;s not a bad person, Heidi.&#34;,
 &#34; You&#39;re right. You&#39;re right, Heidi.&#34;,
 &#39; Hey broship, got a minute?&#39;,
 &#39;Just a second. Please, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay.  Come on, baby.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle Kyle, I know you&#39;ve never had a serious girlfriend, but... we stopped &#34;
 &#39;caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.&#39;,
 &#39;I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room, I &#39;
 &#39;believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do &#39;
 &#34;you remember that, Kyle? Where&#39;s that Kyle?&#34;,
 &#34;No, I know, being in groups is great. You get to gang up and smash people&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;stuff,  pull out your wiener in the cafeteria.  I wonder what the old Kyle &#39;
 &#39;would say about this Kyle? I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted &#39;
 &#34;right now by who he&#39;s become. Heidi&#39;s been working with Denmark, Kyle. I &#34;
 &#34;want to show you what she&#39;s done. It&#39;s gonna change the way you think.&#34;,
 &#39;Like you said you would do, Kyle, except that she actually meant it.&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s funny too, Kyle.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re not giving her credit for being hilarious.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said &#39;
 &#34;Heidi wasn&#39;t funny, that was pretty lame, man.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have thing hangup against &#39;
 &#39;women?!&#39;,
 &#39;You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, to catch trolls.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, Heidi doesn&#39;t actually use the Internet. We&#39;ve sworn off that stuff, &#34;
 &#34;so it&#39;s kewl.&#34;,
 &#39; ...Un oh. &#39;,
 &#39;No, it sucked! I\&#39;m gonna send Butters an e-mail right now.  &#34;Dude, don\&#39;t &#39;
 &#39;bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it.&#34;  Can we &#39;
 &#39;get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. &#39;,
 &#39;How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? &#39;
 &#34;That&#39;s bullshit!&#34;,
 &#39;I gotta go! &#39;,
 &#39;Ack! Dude, weak! Now kewl!  Not kewl! &#39;,
 &#34;No, weak!  It&#39;s all falling apart! Weak! &#34;,
 &#34;I d-I, I don&#39;t know&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just, hard.&#34;,
 &#39;And I do.  This one time...  I think it was ocer the summer, I sent to see &#39;
 &#39;the new Ghostbusters movie.&#39;,
 &#39;And... and during the movie I was like &#34;wait, where\&#39;s my phone?&#34; and I &#39;
 &#39;couldn\&#39;t find it, and Jimmy said &#34;haha screw you, Cartman&#34; and he was &#39;
 &#39;holding my phone and he ran off with it and he said &#34;I\&#39;m gonna send a bunch &#39;
 &#39;of texts and e-mails from your phone so everyone thinks they\&#39;re from you&#34; &#39;
 &#39;and I was like &#34;No, that\&#39;s not cool!&#34; and he said &#34;Yeah!&#34; and he sent a &#39;
 &#39;bunch of mean stuff before I went to ge get him and I took my phone back amd &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m just worried that if, if people look at my Internet history they&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;gonna think that all that stuff came from me!&#39;,
 &#39;So you totally believe me?&#39;,
 &#39; Keeewwl! &#39;,
 &#39; Ah! No! Noo! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?&#39;,
 &#39; Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the &#39;
 &#39;new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect &#39;
 &#34;of it totally sucking balls because women aren&#39;t funny?&#34;,
 &#39;I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you &#39;
 &#39;to e-mail me saing what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Ghostbusters sucked balls&#34; when actually I told you it was really funny &#39;
 &#39;several times in person.&#39;,
 &#39;A traitor?&#39;,
 &#39;Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!&#39;,
 &#39;Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. Neither did I.&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.&#34;,
 &#39;You are smart, Heidi.&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I &#34;
 &#39;seriously lose my shit.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, Heidi. For the first time I&#39;m really scared for the future.&#34;,
 &#39;Heidi? Heidi!&#39;,
 &#34;Sorry, I have to talk to you. It&#39;s really important.&#34;,
 &#39;Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.&#39;,
 &#34;No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. . I&#39;ve seen what&#39;s gonna happen &#34;
 &#39;when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done &#39;
 &#34;things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it&#39;s going to &#34;
 &#39;be very bad. Humandkind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the &#39;
 &#34;people who go to Mars, where there&#39;s no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody &#34;
 &#39;said or did on the Internet, ever.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.  Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know &#39;
 &#34;that I&#39;m doing this to save... us.&#34;,
 &#34;Tha&#39;s kewl.&#34;,
 &#34;We aren&#39;t gonna see home again, babe. We&#39;re gonna make it. There&#39;s no &#34;
 &#39;turning back.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes. I do. &#39;,
 &#34;Hello. I understand that you&#39;re trying to get to Mars. This is my &#34;
 &#34;girlfriend, Heidi. She&#39;s really smart and really funny.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve given up social media and we&#39;d like to be somewhere as far from the &#34;
 &#39;Internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty wi-fi?&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;ll, we&#39;d like to go. We can&#39;t tolerate this world anymore and we&#39;d like &#34;
 &#39;to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible, please.&#39;,
 &#39;What others?  What the fuck, dude?!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw Goddmanit is that Cher?! &#39;,
 &#34; Jesus. I didn&#39;t think getting to Mars would take this long.&#34;,
 &#34;I know, but it&#39;ll be worth it, babe. We&#39;ll be left alone to make our new &#34;
 &#39;world better.&#39;,
 &#39; What the hell are you doing here?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, nonono, you&#39;re a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters! You don&#39;t get to &#34;
 &#39;go to Mars!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, Butters, you expect people to believe that you went from being the &#39;
 &#39;biggest asshole in the school to a soft-hearted feminist like me?! Fat &#39;
 &#39;chance!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah? You just forgot one thing. That women are funny too. That didn&#39;t occur &#34;
 &#39;to you, did it, Butters?!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I know-I mean, when women make vagina jokes, I think it&#39;s the funniest &#34;
 &#39;thing ever.&#39;,
 &#34; Oh, I see what you&#39;re doing.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh nothin&#39;, babe. I&#39;m just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?&#34;,
 &#34;Because you&#39;re  fucking hilarious.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, finally.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please. &#39;
 &#39;We want to go to Mars.&#39;,
 &#39;They already have Pizza Pockets.&#39;,
 &#39;Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all interesting and shit, but can we see the &#39;
 &#39;Mars rocket now?&#39;,
 &#39;Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?&#39;,
 &#39;No, no nonono, we have to go now!&#39;,
 &#39;You got it figured out, babe?&#39;,
 &#39;Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it.  Say &#39;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#39;Get voer it, baby.  Stop holding yourself back. &#39;,
 &#39; What the fuck do you want?!  Hang on, babe. &#39;,
 &#34;Just give her a chance. She&#39;s the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah. That&#39;s because you have a mental block, Elon Musk, that won&#39;t let you &#34;
 &#39;get over yourself.&#39;,
 &#39;What are you doing?!&#39;,
 &#34;I mean, what are you doing calling my girlfriend fuuny! You&#39;d better back &#34;
 &#34;off! You don&#39;t even know her! You haven&#39;t spent any time with her! You&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;just saying it! How do you even know she&#39;s funny?!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters, Heidi is everything to me! If you try and take her, I swear to God &#39;
 &#39;I will-!&#39;,
 &#39;What are you talking about?&#39;,
 &#34;Not Heidi. She&#39;s different. She&#39;s... really... smart. And really... funny!&#34;,
 &#34;I just don&#39;t understand it. She&#39;s always been really smart before. And &#34;
 &#39;hilarious.&#39;,
 &#34;Nobody&#39;s been duped! Stop trying to suggest she&#39;s being manipulative! Why &#34;
 &#39;would she wanna trick me?!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous! That&#39;s the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard! Heidi is the &#34;
 &#34;smartest, funniest person I&#39;ve ever met! I&#39;m not beng tricked! And I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;prove it to everybody!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey baby, uh, hoe&#39;s it going?&#34;,
 &#39; Okay, cool. Um, babe, do you remember that funny thing you were saying &#39;
 &#39;about soup the other day? What was that again?&#39;,
 &#34;Do you, do you um, remember that funny voice you did at McDonald&#39;s. You were &#34;
 &#39;like &#34;Can you, can you hand me my water&#34; or something. I can\&#39;t, I can\&#39;t &#39;
 &#39;remember.&#39;,
 &#39;Or the time you said a thing about clouds, and I was laughing so hard. What &#39;
 &#39;was that again?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay okay now could you just do the &#34;my vagina&#34; thing for them? Could you &#39;
 &#39;just say &#34;my vagina&#34;?&#39;,
 &#39; What the fuck is happening?&#39;,
 &#39;Conniving... snakes in the grass. All of them.&#39;,
 &#39;We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all been leading up to this. We&#39;ve just been too blind to see it &#34;
 &#39;before. &#39;,
 &#39;Maybe just a moment alone? To talk?&#39;,
 &#39;The end of our species.&#39;,
 &#34;Listen, there isn&#39;t much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;go to Mars.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve had visions of Mars for the past few months. I&#39;m a visionary. That&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;why I came here. Why I brought her.  But the visions weren&#39;t complete until &#34;
 &#34;recently.  I know what happens on Mars.  At first, you&#39;ll be super-happy, &#34;
 &#39;bouncing around the red sand.&#39;,
 &#39;Kewl!&#39;,
 &#39;Everyone will be really nice.&#39;,
 &#39; Hi!&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;ll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really kewl. But then &#34;
 &#34;you&#39;ll realize something. The other colonists all seem to be women.&#34;,
 &#34;Hmmm, let&#39;s see...&#34;,
 &#39;And then you\&#39;ll start to wonder, &#34;where are all the guys?&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;And soon you&#39;ll realize there&#39;s areas you didn&#39;t understand the purpose &#34;
 &#39;for. &#39;,
 &#39;What is this place?&#39;,
 &#34;And that&#39;s when you&#39;ll learn the truth.  Men have been forced underground, &#34;
 &#39;deemed useless by women.  They are mined for the only things women still &#39;
 &#39;need us for: our semen and our jokes. &#39;,
 &#34;What? No no! You&#39;re just as funny as us.  You don&#39;t need to do this!  Noooo! &#34;
 &#39;No, nooo.&#39;,
 &#39;Noooo.  Noooo.&#39;,
 &#34;And you&#39;ll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.&#34;,
 &#34;If there&#39;s even a little part of you that doesn&#39;t really believe that, then &#34;
 &#39;think about what else has to be going on. &#39;,
 &#39; You have to help us stop this.&#39;,
 &#34;Elon, I know you&#39;ve dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but it&#39;s not going to &#34;
 &#34;be very kind to Man. They&#39;re going to put us derground.&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the one thing women don&#39;t have? Semen, and a sense of humor.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re pretty related.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the &#34;
 &#34;spider web. And then they... make you think they&#39;re really smart, really &#34;
 &#34;funny, but they&#39;re only really smart, Elon.  They can live without us. We &#34;
 &#34;can&#39;t live without them.  If even 1/16 of you believes women might not be as &#34;
 &#39;funny as men, Elon- /i&gt; Elon?&#39;,
 &#34;What the hell am I gonna do, Butters?? I can&#39;t live without Heidi. I know &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;ll be miserable. But I also can&#39;t live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.&#34;,
 &#39;If I stay on Earth where the Internet is, Heidi finds out I know women &#39;
 &#34;aren&#39;t actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat. &#34;,
 &#34;Is that Kyle?  Kyle, do you mind?! I&#39;m having really big girl problems right &#34;
 &#39;now!&#39;,
 &#39;Attention, all SpaceX employees. Please evacuate the building immediately. &#39;
 &#34;We&#39;ve just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. The NASA &#34;
 &#39;terrorists are super-jelly of us.  Please quietly and calmly find the &#39;
 &#39;nearest exit, and get the fuck out as fast as you can.  Ah! Oh, hey babe. &#39;
 &#34;What-what&#39;s up?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, yeah. I was just um- They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was &#39;
 &#34;spinning. Come on, we&#39;d better get out. &#34;,
 &#34;Distant? Really? Oh my God, I-I&#39;m sorry. &#34;,
 &#39;No. No, Heid.  Why would you think that?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh huh, uh hun, Yeah, go on. &#39;,
 &#34;Uh huh. Yeah, kewl. Uh, Heidi, I&#39;ll always do what&#39;s best for both of us. &#34;
 &#34;Now, come on. We&#39;ve got to get outside.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, looks like you&#39;re gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon? Maybe &#34;
 &#39;you should just go back to your little cars, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah well, some people&#39;s dreams are other people&#39;s nightmares.&#34;,
 &#39;It was a joke.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, let\&#39;s try this one: Alexa, add &#34;big hairy &#39;
 &#39;balls&#34; to my shopping list.&#39;,
 &#39;Alexa, Simon says &#34;I got vagina crabs in my butthole.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s the best one yet!  Oh, you guys! I swear this is the greatest thing &#34;
 &#39;ever! You do one, Token! &#39;,
 &#34; Oh, hey babe, what&#39;s goin&#39; on?&#34;,
 &#34;Nnnothing, I&#39;m just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay? &#34;,
 &#34;Ugh, I&#39;m not pissed off, I&#39;m just hanging out.&#34;,
 &#34; Aw guys, guys, don&#39;t leave, guys! Everything&#39;s kewl!&#34;,
 &#39; Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.&#39;,
 &#34;Just like you tell me what you&#39;re mad about every single day.&#34;,
 &#39;Uuugh. &#39;,
 &#39;Uuugh! &#39;,
 &#39;Alexa, add &#34;titty chips&#34; to my shopping list.&#39;,
 &#39;Alexa, Set alarm for 7 am.&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome, thanks.  Alexa, tell me a joke.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahhaha, that\&#39;s stupid. Alexa, add &#34;scrotum bags&#34; to my shopping list.&#39;,
 &#39; Eh.  Ah, fuck.  Hey baby, how are you?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I just use it sometimes.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah I know- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you&#39;re right, I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m sorry. &#34;
 &#39;Yes, Ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight.  Jesus, fuck!  Alexa, goodnight.&#39;,
 &#39;Alexa, are you happy?&#39;,
 &#39;God, that\&#39;s so cool. You\&#39;re so... Alexa, define &#34;subservient.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39; Alexa, silence!  Ahhh. &#39;,
 &#39;It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.&#39;,
 &#39;Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going &#39;
 &#34;off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It&#39;s bih, it&#39;s been going on for a long &#34;
 &#34;time. Heidi&#39;s... mentally abousive, guys. There, I said it.&#34;,
 &#34;She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything&#39;s a head game &#34;
 &#34;with her. You don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to live with it! You don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;understahand!&#39;,
 &#39;I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs &#39;
 &#34;help. I have to give her that help, but I&#39;m scared. Can I count on you &#34;
 &#34;guys&#39;s support?&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. But Alexa will. Alexa&#39;s fuckin&#39; sweet.&#34;,
 &#34;Alexa, I&#39;m home.  Alexa?  Alexa, I&#39;m home!  Alexa?  Alexa, where aer you?  &#34;
 &#39;Alexa! Alexa! Simon says &#34;puffy vaginal hemorrhoids&#34;!  What the hell is &#39;
 &#39;going on?! &#39;,
 &#34;Mom, Alexa left! She&#39;s not here.&#34;,
 &#39; What have you done with her?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s a Jim Bob?&#34;,
 &#39;Jim Bob, Simon says &#34;big frosty semen shake.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;NOOOOO!&#39;,
 &#34;Everything&#39;s my fault. You&#39;re right. Everything that you did to me, I &#34;
 &#39;deserved it.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry.  I&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;do the best I can.&#39;,
 &#39; Mehhh.&#39;,
 &#39;Heidi, silence!&#39;,
 &#34; You&#39;re right, I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m sorry.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay, cool. I&#39;m so happy we&#39;re back on track. See you at school tomorrow. &#34;
 &#39;Love you honey. &#39;,
 &#39; I nove ya tuh.&#39;,
 &#39;Aaaahh!  Alexa? &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, oh God!  Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add &#39;
 &#39;&#34;Hey Siri, call me.&#34; Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says &#34;Suck &#39;
 &#39;my big balls in your hairy butthole.&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;Alexa, what is love?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m finally standing up to you.&#34;,
 &#34;You&#39;re messed up, Heidi, and I can&#39;t fix you. Only you can do that.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not going to work on me anymore. Love isn&#39;t supposed to hurt. I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. &#39;,
 &#34; Anyone can convince themselves that they&#39;re the victim in a relationship. &#34;
 &#39;Now Heidi will have to face the truth.  Alone.&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, Craig, you&#39;ve gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He&#39;s freaking &#34;
 &#39;everybody out at school.&#39;,
 &#34; Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay?  If you don&#39;t have some &#34;
 &#34;fuckin&#39; balls, you&#39;re not gonna get anywhere. Doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re gay &#34;
 &#34;balls or straight balls. If you don&#39;t take control of your side of the &#34;
 &#39;relationship, you get walked all over-!&#39;,
 &#34; Oh hay baby, what&#39;d going on? &#34;,
 &#34;Yep, I&#39;ll be there&#34;,
 &#39;I decided to give her one more chance.&#39;,
 &#39;She is mentally abusive.&#39;,
 &#39;Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke &#39;
 &#39;up with her and she calls me being all like &#34;I can\&#39;t live without you, I\&#39;m &#39;
 &#39;scared, what am I gonna do to myself? Oh God.&#34; The bitch is crazy. What am I &#39;
 &#39;supposed to do?&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;You have to take me back! You have to! I\&#39;m gonna kill myself, Heidi!&#34;  &#39;
 &#39;&#34;I\&#39;m gonna kill myself and then you\&#39;ll be sorry! You\&#39;ll wish you could &#39;
 &#39;have me back, but I\&#39;ll be deeaad.&#34;  &#34;Please, Heidi, please!&#34; &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people&#39;s private voice mails!&#34;,
 &#34; That&#39;s great! I&#39;m glad you guys think suicide is so funny! &#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t think kids at this school take  suicide seriously enough, and we &#34;
 &#39;need to raise awareness!&#39;,
 &#39;Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?&#39;,
 &#34;PC Principal, someone&#39;s life is at stake! If I have to compete with &#34;
 &#34;distracted driving, then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.&#34;,
 &#34; Hey guys, let&#39;s take a minute and talk about suicide preventon. There&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;probably someone right now at this school thinkin&#39; about killing himself, &#34;
 &#34;and it&#39;s not funny!  You&#39;d better take him serious, or he might actually do &#34;
 &#34;it.  I&#39;ve been feelin&#39; sad, I&#39;ve been bein&#39; sad, Can&#39;t talk to my mom, don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;even have a dad. I can\&#39;t go on. What is livin\&#39; for? My heart screams &#34;I &#39;

 &#34;life a try. Eric, we don&#39;t want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric. I don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.  But Eric, we don&#39;t want you &#34;
 &#34;to die. You&#39;re so kewl, we&#39;d be sad at school.  Yeah, but you guys, you &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t understand. With my girlfriend, it&#39;s like I&#39;m livin&#39; in quicksand &#34;
 &#39;Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter. My girlfriend is &#39;
 &#34;messed up, but all I wanna do is help her. I&#39;m sufficatin&#39;, I&#39;m drowning in &#34;
 &#39;sorrow. Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.  But Eric, we &#39;
 &#34;don&#39;t want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.  Everybody!  Eric, we don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric. But it&#39;s so hard! Eric, we don&#39;t &#34;
 &#34;want you to die Only you guys can make a difference. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you &#39;
 &#34;all start taking it seriously! Eric, please don&#39;t die  Distracted driving my &#34;
 &#39;asshole. &#39;,
 &#34; Well, how nice. That&#39;s a little more like it.  Well guys, what happened? &#34;
 &#39;Change of heart?&#39;,
 &#39;What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, that son of a bitch!  I&#39;m gonna talk to the principal!  Put down that &#34;
 &#39;candle, Kenny!  Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec!&#39;,
 &#34; PC Principal, I&#39;m trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;preoccupied with this &#34;don\&#39;t be on your phone when driving&#34; crap!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There&#39;s nothing we can do for him! &#34;
 &#39;Students need to focus on people thinking about dying!&#39;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full &#34;
 &#39;orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need blkck people in white robes, white &#39;
 &#39;people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!&#39;,
 &#39; Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with &#39;
 &#39;suuicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! &#39;
 &#39;Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on &#39;
 &#39;the streets!&#39;,
 &#39;Maybe I will!&#39;,
 &#39;Maybe I will!!&#39;,
 &#39; Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help &#39;
 &#34;tell people like Kyle it&#39;s not a joke.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I&#39;m gonna do it.&#34;,
 &#39;They want to get help? For what?&#39;,
 &#39;No, this is about me killiing myself.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re full of shit, Heidi. They&#39;re just trying to get attention. What, are &#34;
 &#39;you actually talking online to these asswipes?!&#39;,
 &#34;So you&#39;re just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a deathwish?! &#34;
 &#39;Are we just your type?!&#39;,
 &#34;No, look, Heidi. I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re the one who started all this by &#34;
 &#34;telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I&#39;m under a lot of &#34;
 &#39;pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide &#39;
 &#34;prevention becomes this entire town&#39;s number one priority! &#34;,
 &#39;Oh, are you freaking serious?!&#39;,
 &#34; Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there&#39;s also gonna be a suicide awareness pot &#34;
 &#34;luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We&#39;re gonna have lots &#34;
 &#39;of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, &#39;
 &#34;so you don&#39;t want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody.&#34;,
 &#34;They&#39;re doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What&#39;s that gonna &#34;
 &#39;solve?&#39;,
 &#34;You are so up and down. I don&#39;t know what you want from me, Heidi!&#34;,
 &#34;So now you&#39;re on their side! Oh my God, I&#39;m seriously gonna do it right &#34;
 &#39;now! &#39;,
 &#39; Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation Or I will rip my own guts &#39;
 &#34;out without one hesitation  Dedication, that&#39;s what it&#39;s taken to awaken &#34;
 &#34;people to care  And yet my future&#39;s so hazy, my girlfriend&#39;s makin&#39; me crazy &#34;
 &#34;But still I&#39;m workin&#39; so hard. You know, just tryin&#39; to hold on,  &#39;Cause I &#34;
 &#34;know that you don&#39;t mess me so much if I was gone.  And all the voices start &#34;
 &#39;solo, but every day I hear them grow. Sayiin\&#39; &#34;Eroc, don\&#39;t do it! Don\&#39;t &#39;
 &#39;do it! Noooo (noooo, noooo)&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I&#39;m not gonna do it!&#34;,
 &#39; This is an outrage! This is a violation of our human rights! &#39;,
 &#34;You didn&#39;t hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have &#34;
 &#39;to come to school on Mondy!&#39;,
 &#39;Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist &#39;
 &#39;and should be eliminated!&#39;,
 &#39;Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. &#39;
 &#34;That&#39;s what matter.&#34;,
 &#39;And totally act liek we care. I like it, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, this is sweet. It&#39;s like that movie where the dude pretended to be on &#34;
 &#34;the monsters&#39; side? Uou know, with the guy and the chick that had the &#34;
 &#39;wifebeater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, this is a lot like that. What&#39;d you find, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39; What? What? What the hell was that?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#39;Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, okay, just say we&#39;re gonna cut off part of his dick.&#34;,
 &#39;Guys, what are you going?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-&#34;,
 &#39;Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! &#39;
 &#39;Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his &#39;
 &#39;own country wouldn\&#39;t support his cause, Columbus said &#34;Fine! I\&#39;ll go find &#39;
 &#39;a new land, where kids can have that day off!&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there &#39;
 &#39;who said &#34;No! Sty off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!&#34;, &#39;
 &#39;he said &#34;No! It\&#39;s just one day in October! They need a break!&#34; You guys can &#39;
 &#34;all give up, but I&#39;m not. Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off &#34;
 &#39;skewl. With just three shhips he sailed over so we could have some me time &#39;
 &#39;in October. And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut But if &#39;
 &#34;we don&#39;t get that day off of school, then... for what?&#34;,
 &#34; All right, it&#39;s clear. Bring him in. &#34;,
 &#39; Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think?&#39;,
 &#39;Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of &#39;
 &#39;money.&#39;,
 &#34;Alright, superheros, it&#39;s time to lay out our plan of action. As you can &#34;
 &#39;see, I have divided the franschise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins &#39;
 &#39;with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United &#39;
 &#39;movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon &#39;
 &#39;vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right. It&#39;s in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black &#34;
 &#39;superhero, like an ace in the hole.&#39;,
 &#39;Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literraly &#39;
 &#34;buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron&#39;s hot. &#34;
 &#39;Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- &#39;,
 &#39;Onscreen!&#39;,
 &#39;What is it, Supercraig?&#39;,
 &#39;Who would deliberatly use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?&#39;,
 &#39;Butters?!&#39;,
 &#39;Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?&#39;,
 &#34;If we don&#39;t find a way to stop him, we&#39;re never gonna make any money, you &#34;
 &#39;guys.&#39;,
 &#39;Wilson Aubrey?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We&#39;re uhm, just wondering why you &#34;
 &#39;stopped following us on Instagram?&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s not true, Wilson. We&#39;re Coon and Friends, not Harbey Weinstein.&#34;,
 &#34;But it&#39;s NOT true.&#34;,
 &#34; Okay, but it&#39;s NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and &#34;
 &#39;decide shit for yourself!&#39;,
 &#34;God damnit! Let&#39;s just face it! We&#39;re never gonna have a superhero &#34;
 &#39;franchise!&#39;,
 &#39;Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.&#39;,
 &#34;Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what&#39;s important. We &#34;
 &#39;just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak &#39;
 &#39;for itself!&#39;,
 &#39;Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon friends because we care about &#39;
 &#34;each other. Because we have each other&#39;s back! And when things look their &#34;
 &#34;darkest, these heroes will stand together!  And we&#39;ll-!&#34;,
 &#39; Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting &#39;
 &#39;evil-is that okay?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now?&#39;,
 &#39;Becasue we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can &#39;
 &#39;do anything!&#39;,
 &#39; Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for &#39;
 &#39;Metflix.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;d like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of &#34;
 &#39;three.&#39;,
 &#39;Yyes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins &#34;
 &#39;Coon and Friends.&#39;,
 &#34;Look, you didn&#39;, you didn&#39;t read that on the news you read that on Facebook!&#34;,
 &#39;Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a lot harder than you think!&#34;,
 &#39;Butters!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah! I don&#39;t have buttsex with antelopes and Token doeesn&#39;t poop in girls&#39; &#34;
 &#39;nouths!&#39;,
 &#39;When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. tha tno matter what it &#39;
 &#39;took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, &#39;
 &#34;right now, we are a superhero group that can&#39;t even get a show on Netflix.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re gonna beat him at his own game.&#34;,
 &#39; Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children!  &#39;
 &#34;This one, simply protesting for black lives!  And this child tryin&#39; to speak &#34;
 &#39;out for handicapped people!&#39;,
 &#39;And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of &#39;
 &#39;Jews!&#39;,
 &#39; Ever heard of Facebook Live?  We are just kids trying to have our voices &#39;
 &#39;heard for Black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by &#39;
 &#39;Mark Zuckerberg.&#39;,
 &#34; Facebook says it&#39;s true.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s over, Chaos!  We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder &#34;
 &#39;device!&#39;,
 &#39;Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV &#39;
 &#39;show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise &#39;
 &#39;plan.  You can see that the Supercraig movie now precedes the Coon vs. &#39;
 &#34;Supercraig movie, followed by Mysterion&#39;s video game. And then we-&#34;,
 &#34;You have a movie, Mysterion. You&#39;re in the third Coon and Friends United &#34;
 &#39;movie , after your video game.&#39;,
 &#39;Not everyone gets their own movie!&#39;,
 &#34;Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don&#39;t even have one movie yet!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!&#39;,
 &#34;Go ahead! I bet you don&#39;t even get halfway through Phase 1 on your &#34;
 &#39;franchise, DC Comics! &#39;,
 &#39;Shut up, Supercraig.&#39;,
 &#39;Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for &#39;
 &#39;him?&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s old. He&#39;s supposed to be miserable.&#34;,
 &#39;Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!&#39;,
 &#34;Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They&#39;re coming after you! You killed &#34;
 &#39;Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people &#39;
 &#39;we had no idea what was going on!&#39;,
 &#34;Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan&#39;s grandpa &#34;
 &#39;in!&#39;,
 &#34;Ohooo, you&#39;re dead Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.&#39;,
 &#34; Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don&#39;t, there&#39;s no way &#34;
 &#39;we can sneak into an old follks home, distract all the old people, and take &#39;
 &#34;an old lady&#39;s Hummels!  Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that.&#34;,
 &#39;I know how to distract old people.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yes, hello. We are adorable chhildren here to entertain old people.&#39;,
 &#34;Yes that&#39;s right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.&#34;,
 &#39;All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to &#39;
 &#39;lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you &#39;
 &#39;can enjoy some nice old-people music. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m... insane in the membrane.&#34;,
 &#39;In the membrane.&#39;,
 &#39;Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys&#39;,
 &#39;Damn right!&#39;,
 &#34;My hot milkshake. And now here&#39;s our own take on that oldie but goodie by &#34;
 &#39;Nirvana.&#39;,
 &#39;Rape me.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!&#39;,
 &#39;Fuck you!  If you&#39;,
 &#39;Just go ahead now&#39;,
 &#39;I come around. &#39;,

 &#39; Come on, come on...  Sweetheart, can we get going, please?&#39;,
 &#34;Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and &#39;member how I was &#34;
 &#39;saying I want to get there early?&#39;,
 &#34; Great, perfect. Let&#39;s go to the pumpkin patch.&#34;,
 &#39;Wha-what?&#39;,
 &#34; The spider&#39;s great.&#34;,
 &#39; Why does she do this every time?&#39;,
 &#34; I said it&#39;s time. Boy, look at the time.&#34;,
 &#34; &#39;Key, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch.&#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t need glitter lip gloss!&#34;,
 &#34;No! No, we don&#39;t need to talk! Ah, I&#39;m super happy!&#34;,
 &#39;Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome.&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, come on, let&#39;s go.&#34;,
 &#34; Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It&#39;s been open for over an hour &#34;
 &#39;now! &#39;,
 &#39; Awesome. Here we go, heading out now!&#39;,
 &#39;No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-&#39;,
 &#39;See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh my fucking God!&#39;,
 &#39;Arrrrrrrrgh!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, we are just getting here.&#39;,
 &#34;The petting zoo&#39;s cl- The petting zoo&#39;s closed?&#34;,
 &#39;What do you mean?! I just got here!&#39;,
 &#39;No! I missed it! I missed it all! &#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Yes. You&#39;re right, guys. It&#39;s my only way out.&#34;,
 &#39;Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the &#39;
 &#34;creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that&#39;s right. Stan and Kyle &#34;
 &#39;will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once &#39;
 &#39;inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-&#39;,
 &#34;This is how we&#39;re going to get rid of Heidi.&#34;,
 &#39;You guys said you would help me get rid of her!&#39;,
 &#39;Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell you guys!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve tried! It&#39;s impossible!&#34;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You &#34;
 &#34;don&#39;t know &#39;cause you&#39;ve never had a girlfriend, Kyle!  Fine. Just leave me &#34;
 &#39;to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about &#39;
 &#39;it! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, babe.&#39;,
 &#34;Listen uh, there&#39;s a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you &#34;
 &#39;and me should go. What do you say?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a &#39;
 &#39;little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.&#39;,
 &#34;Cool. I&#39;ll pick you up at 5.&#34;,
 &#34; Ohohoh, I&#39;m counting on it. &#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party.  I&#39;m sure the &#34;
 &#34;witch won&#39;t even notice us.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, Heidi, if we&#39;d been on time, we wouldn&#39;t need to take a short cut. But &#34;
 &#39;I wanted to give you your space to get ready.&#39;,
 &#39;Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you &#39;
 &#34;had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can&#39;t blame you for missing the &#34;
 &#39;pumpkin patch.&#39;,
 &#39; Sweet. Come on, come on.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too &#39;
 &#39;late.&#39;,
 &#39;She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from &#39;
 &#39;Germany.&#39;,
 &#39;Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!&#39;,
 &#39;Ohhhhh!&#39;,
 &#39;I will have your badge, sir!&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s gonna be a while.&#34;,
 &#34; Yeah, no. I&#39;ve been ready for a couple hours now.&#34;,
 &#39; Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-&#39;,
 &#39;Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry. Okay? Please!&#34;,
 &#34;Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that&#39;s what happens after I eat! My &#34;
 &#39;blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I crash!&#39;,
 &#34;But ih, but it&#39;s true, Heidi! It&#39;s all my mom&#39;s fault. She feeds me all this &#34;
 &#34;crap, and my body doesn&#39;t know how to process it. Mom! Mom!&#34;,
 &#39;You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you &#39;
 &#39;bitch?! Get outta here!&#39;,
 &#39;Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?&#39;,
 &#39;It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I &#39;
 &#39;need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more &#39;
 &#39;than ever. I wand to do this. Please!&#39;,
 &#34;Yes, Heidi! That&#39;s how much I love you! I&#39;m vegan from now non.&#34;,
 &#39;Okay. Okay, bye, honey. &#39;,
 &#39;That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for &#39;
 &#39;me?! Fuck her, dude!&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s not a girlfriend! She&#39;s a controlling, manipulative whore!&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s because you don&#39;t understand how much it sucks to be in a &#34;
 &#39;relationship!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh hey babe, what&#39;s going on?&#34;,
 &#34;Nothin&#39;, just tellin&#39; the guys how awesome it is to be vegan.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. &#39;,
 &#34;Heidi!  Oh my God, you&#39;re not gonna believe this.&#34;,
 &#39;You were so right  when you said there were vegan options for everything.  &#39;
 &#39;Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I tried it and you were right. You can&#39;t even tell the difference &#34;
 &#39;between that and real meat.&#39;,
 &#34;So now I&#39;ve been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;called Beyond KFC.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try &#34;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#34;I know, right?! Isn&#39;t that crazy?!  Like, like seriously, how can you even &#34;
 &#39;tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy &#39;
 &#39;too.  They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a &#39;
 &#34;prottein boost.  I don&#39;t know about you, but I could eat this every day.&#34;,
 &#39; Delicious.&#39;,
 &#39; You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? &#39;,
 &#34;Well uh, we&#39;ve been trying some different foods lately and uh,  Heidi&#39;s put &#34;
 &#39;on some pounds, you guys.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, Token. Don&#39;t start rippin&#39; on me for havin&#39; a fat girlfriend, all &#34;
 &#39;right? Just try and be cool about it. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What&#39;s goin&#39; on? &#34;,
 &#39;Pick you up? That could be tough. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the &#39;
 &#34;nurse&#39;s office. &#34;,
 &#39;Oh sure. &#39;,
 &#34;Sure, Kyle. What&#39;s up? &#34;,
 &#34;Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There&#39;s always two &#34;
 &#39;sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each &#39;
 &#34;other, but it&#39;s all part of trying to make each other better.  Someday, &#34;
 &#34;maybe you&#39;ll have a girlfriend and you&#39;ll understand. Oh, here she comes.  &#34;
 &#34;BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi&#39;s comin&#39; through.&#34;,
 &#34;I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It&#39;s his &#34;
 &#39;favorite.&#39;,
 &#34;You betcha, can&#39;t wait.&#34;,
 &#39; BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!&#39;,
 &#39; Please Heidi! &#39;,
 &#39;Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei-  Hei-, Hei-, Hei-&#39;,

 &#39;I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here &#39;
 &#39;with you, please?&#39;,
 &#39;I know how you feel now, Token. To be pissed off at the world. To feel &#39;
 &#39;completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what &#39;
 &#39;you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff.  Token, &#39;
 &#34;pleeease! I&#39;m sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys &#34;

 &#34;Well yeah, no, it&#39;s great. It&#39;s just- well, what time do you guys usually go &#34;

 &#39;over cars today. Did I miss it?&#39;,
 &#34;Please, I don&#39;t know what to do with all this anger and hurt!&#34;,
 &#34;No, no, we&#39;ve broken up before, but this time it&#39;s different. I can tell. &#34;

 &#39; Aaah!  Ugh!  Fuck you, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;What are you doing here?&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s good to know, &#39;cause like, nothing helps more when you&#39;re down than &#34;
 &#39;knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care.&#39;,
 &#39;No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.&#39;,
 &#34;No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There&#39;s stuff I never told you. It&#39;s &#34;

[&#34;Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain&#39;t nothin&#39; upstairs but an old, stupid &#34;
 &#34;party anyways. It&#39;s better down here in the kids&#39; room.  Uh, this here is &#34;
 &#34;Dougie. He&#39;s not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he&#39;s in &#34;

 &#39;noses and all.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we &#39;
 &#34;could play Charlie&#39;s Angels.&#34;,
 &#34;No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie&#39;s Angels, and &#34;
 &#34;I get to be Jaclyn Smith &#39;cause I thought of it.&#34;,
 &#34;Well, I don&#39;t know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, &#34;
 &#39;little first-grade kid?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, that&#39;s because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what &#34;
 &#39;their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be &#39;
 &#39;Bosley. &#39;,
 &#34;Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that&#39;s all. &#34;
 &#34;That&#39;s all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish &#34;
 &#39;it.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, what are we waitin&#39; for? We&#39;ve gotta find a way out of this room, by &#34;
 &#34;golly, or else we&#39;re gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! &#34;,
 &#39;Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation &#39;
 &#34;duct. And I reckon it&#39;s got to lead somewhere, and and it&#39;s good &#39;cause, uh &#34;
 &#34;&#39;cause now we won&#39;t drown.&#34;,
 &#34;Upstairs? Uhwhy why there&#39;s ain&#39;t nothin&#39; upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would &#34;
 &#39;we want to go upstairs for?&#39;,
 &#34;So what&#39;s our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, &#34;

 &#34;Wwe ain&#39;t got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We&#39;re &#34;
 &#39;Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?&#39;,

 &#39;the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! &#39;,

 &#34;Don&#39;t be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.&#34;,
 &#39; Yes sir! &#39;,
 &#34;We won&#39;t know until we&#39;re at Bennigan&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;Dad&#39;s a good shopper all right.&#34;,
 &#34;You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain&#39;t that kind of like... fibbin&#39;?&#34;,
 &#39;Sure I do!&#39;,
 &#34; Inspector Butters in on the case, ma&#39;am! &#34;,
 &#34; Uh, that&#39;s me!&#34;,
 &#34; Hm. Dad&#39;s going to see a movie. How nice.&#34;,
 &#39; &#34;White Swallow Bath House&#34;&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, that&#39;s me!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m back, Ma!&#34;,
 &#39;I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.&#39;,
 &#39;Well first, he went to see a movie.&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. But it wasn&#39;t the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, &#34;
 &#34;really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn&#39;t know it was open. &#34;,
 &#39;&#34;Fisting Firemen 9&#34;  I\&#39;ve never seen 1 through 8.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, &#39;
 &#39;like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, &#39;
 &#39;he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the &#39;
 &#39;movie really got to him.&#39;,
 &#39;To the gym.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.&#39;,
 &#34;Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o&#39; guys. He wasn&#39;t too &#34;
 &#39;good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for firteen minutes &#39;
 &#39;straight!&#39;,
 &#39;Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.  The &#39;
 &#34;only thing I can&#39;t figure out is why dad told you he was goin&#39; shoppin&#39; for &#34;
 &#34;yoru present when he was goin&#39; out to see the movies an&#39; wrestlin&#39;.  Oh, did &#34;
 &#39;you have a nice &#34;trip,&#34; Mom? See you next &#34;fall.&#34; Hahaha, yo- Ma?&#39;,
 &#34; Uh, that&#39;s me!&#34;,
 &#34;Hm. Uh-I can&#39;t think of one.&#34;,
 &#39; Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, a new paint brush. That&#39;s what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. &#34;
 &#39;I gotta go tell him. &#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s me!&#34;,
 &#39;One please.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh thanks! &#39;,
 &#39; Dad?  Dad, you in here?&#39;,
 &#39;Hello? Eh-anybody in here?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh Mr. Garrison?&#39;,
 &#34; Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin&#39; in here?  Dad?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  ndad? No.  Hm. &#39;,

 &#34;Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she&#39;s fine.&#34;,
 &#34;A drive? Oh, boy!  I I love a good drive. Is Dad comin&#39; too?&#34;,
 &#39; Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, jeez, you wouldn&#39;t have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had &#34;
 &#34;to share my fingerpaints, because I&#39;ve been sharin&#39; them all along.&#34;,
 &#39;Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin&#39; &#34;
 &#39;&#34;nutsack&#34; in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself. &#39;,
 &#39;Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens &#39;

 &#34;Please, fellas, uh don&#39;t fire me.&#34;,
 &#34; The world isn&#39;t fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the &#34;
 &#39;lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury &#39;
 &#39;Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an &#39;
 &#39;outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from &#39;
 &#34;others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I&#39;m through doin&#39; what &#34;
 &#39;others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the &#39;
 &#39;stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos &#39;
 &#39;to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  &#39;
 &#39;the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow! &#39;,
 &#34;Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you&#39;ve ever &#34;
 &#39;seen! Professor Chaos! &#39;,
 &#39;Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. &#39;,
 &#39;I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uhwill bow down to me! &#39;,
 &#39;Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! &#39;,
 &#39;Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing &#39;
 &#34;chaos!  And that&#39;s only the beginning! &#34;,
 &#34; It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what&#39;s been goin&#39; on? Some &#34;
 &#39;horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot &#39;
 &#34;Bennigan&#39;s.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeh, you didn&#39;t? &#34;,
 &#39;Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?&#39;,
 &#34; Nothing.  Nothing!  It&#39;s the liberal media! They&#39;re keeping the stories of &#34;
 &#34;my deads covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it&#39;s time to &#34;
 &#39;take it up a notch! &#39;,
 &#34; Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won&#39;t find it. That eraser&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do &#39;
 &#39;you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear &#39;
 &#34;chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin&#39; up and &#34;
 &#34;pilin&#39; up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! &#34;,
 &#39; So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!&#39;,
 &#39;Ms. Choksondik,&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.&#39;,
 &#34; Alright. I&#39;m goin&#39; to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;where I&#39;ll be.&#34;,
 &#39; The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! &#39;,
 &#39;I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do &#39;
 &#39;not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at &#39;
 &#39;hand! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh! Ah, I&#39;m back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.&#34;,
 &#39;Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and &#39;
 &#34;look at it. It&#39;s scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my &#34;
 &#34;elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos&#39;s trail.&#34;,
 &#39;It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in &#39;
 &#39;bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of &#39;
 &#39;chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring &#39;
 &#39;dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!&#39;,
 &#39;A note?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a &#39;
 &#34;trap set by the FBI. Oh, I&#39;ll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I &#34;
 &#34;who&#39;ll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven&#39;t much time!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.&#39;,
 &#39;Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your &#39;
 &#39;own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal &#39;
 &#39;down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.&#39;,
 &#39;Join me?&#39;,
 &#39;But why?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring &#39;
 &#39;the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society &#39;
 &#39;run... red.&#39;,
 &#39;Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now &#39;
 &#39;on you are General... Disarray.&#39;,
 &#34;Now let us go look for my minions!  They ran away here, now to find &#39;em... &#34;,
 &#39;People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor &#39;
 &#39;Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few &#39;
 &#39;days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it &#39;
 &#39;is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under &#39;
 &#39;leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do &#39;
 &#39;to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this &#39;
 &#39;upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as &#39;
 &#39;your precious planet drowns! Watch! &#39;,
 &#39;Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  &#39;
 &#39;Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? &#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure &#39;
 &#34;is takin&#39; a long time.&#34;,
 &#39;Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh yeah. I hadn&#39;t thought o&#39; that. That&#39;s a pretty good idea. I&#39;ll go get a &#34;
 &#39;hammer.  Hey, who is that? &#39;,
 &#34;Heeyyy, what are you doin&#39;?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will &#34;
 &#39;be back!&#39;,
 &#39; Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... &#39;
 &#39;almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me &#39;
 &#39;with no other choice!&#39;,
 &#39;This is is, General Disarray. My final solution. &#39;,
 &#34;Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth&#39;s precious &#34;
 &#39;atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn &#39;
 &#34;all the world with the, with the... hu- sun&#39;s harmful rays!  Say goodbye to &#34;
 &#39;your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, &#39;
 &#39;General Disarray. &#39;,
 &#39; Hey, fellas.&#39;,
 &#39;How are things... oing with your new best friend?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, but he&#39;s still better than you, Butters.&#34;,
 &#34;Well ah, that&#39;s good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you&#39;ll &#34;
 &#39;do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. &#39;,
 &#34; Wokay, mom. Ah I&#39;m just gonna be up here, uh doin&#39; my homework.  Yes. By &#34;
 &#39;day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT...  nobody knows &#39;
 &#39;that he actually has a dark underside...  Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to &#39;
 &#39;wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! &#39;,
 &#39;Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet &#39;
 &#39;to wreak havoc on humanity. &#39;,
 &#39;Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge &#39;
 &#39;...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this &#39;
 &#39;hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.&#39;,
 &#39;Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to &#39;
 &#39;remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! &#39;,
 &#39; Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein&#39; original.&#34;,
 &#34;Aww, I don&#39;t wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  &#34;
 &#39;I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I &#39;
 &#39;think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?&#39;,
 &#39;General Disarray, are your parents home?&#39;,
 &#34;Ah, I&#39;ve done it, General Disarray. I&#39;ve completed my most horrible deed to &#34;
 &#39;date.&#39;,
 &#39;You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I &#39;
 &#39;snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, &#39;
 &#39;yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;Hahaha, and they&#39;re probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on &#34;
 &#39;the news! &#39;,
 &#34;Look! Look! I&#39;ve made the news! I-I&#39;ve wreaked havoc!&#34;,
 &#34;I finally made the world sorry! I&#39;ve brought sadness, a-and chaos!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.&#39;,
 &#34;Well why didn&#39;t you tell me the Simpsons already did that?&#34;,
 &#39; Stupid Simpsons...&#39;,
 &#34;Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I&#39;m going&#39; to pose as a real-estate agent &#34;
 &#34;and con everyone in town into buyin&#39; a monorail. And then skip town with all &#34;
 &#39;their money.  No?&#39;,
 &#34;Wokay , then I&#39;m goin&#39; to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about &#34;
 &#34;everyone in town! And and then I&#39;ll take their-&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;ll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think &#34;
 &#39;a fallen angel has fallen-&#39;,
 &#39;Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy &#39;
 &#39;the-&#39;,
 &#39; Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge &#39;
 &#39;mixer at the paint store so that-&#39;,
 &#34; Fine! Then maybe I&#39;ll just forget about destroying the town and just run &#34;
 &#39;away and join the circus! &#39;,
 &#39;Dwaah!!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve done it, General Disarray. I&#39;ve watches all one hundred and thirty-two &#34;
 &#34;episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I&#39;ve finally come up with something... &#34;
 &#39;tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will &#39;
 &#39;take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside &#39;
 &#39;instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are &#39;
 &#34;gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they&#39;ll get a &#34;
 &#34;mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You&#39;ve never ...seen &#34;
 &#39;this on the Simpsons, right?&#39;,
 &#39;Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for &#39;
 &#39;sh-shunning us!&#39;,
 &#34;Nnno , uh no, no, it can&#39;t be.&#34;,
 &#39;No! No! &#39;,
 &#39;Aaaaah!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh sweet Jesus!&#39;,
 &#39;Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!&#39;,
 &#39;Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! &#39;,
 &#39; Haaah! &#39;,
 &#39; Aaah! Nooo! &#39;,
 &#39; Haaa!&#39;,
 &#39;Cartman?&#39;,
 &#39; Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!&#39;,
 &#39;They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The &#39;
 &#39;Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and &#39;
 &#34;makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she&#39;s God! &#34;
 &#39;Ha! Hahaha!&#39;,
 &#34;Really? So I shouldn&#39;t care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons &#34;
 &#34;already did it. It... uh...doesn&#39;t... matter.  Everything is back to normal, &#34;
 &#34;a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin&#39; to destroy the world again.&#34;,
 &#34; I feel like a spring chicken. I&#39;m ready to wreak havoc once again! &#34;,
 &#39;Compassionate.&#39;,
 &#39;You mean, like a goldfish?&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? &#39;,
 &#34; Wuuhh, it&#39;s really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the &#34;
 &#39;driver gets angry, you blame me.&#39;,
 &#34;Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;,
 &#39; Uh here comes an SUV. &#39;,
 &#39;Me too!&#39;,
 &#39; Stupider than Bebe!&#39;,
 &#34;Huh Bebe&#39;s cool, huh. Huh, fellas?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Uhyep.&#39;,
 &#39; Then we gotta work on your campaign.&#39;,
 &#34; Oooo, they&#39;re all hard and oogey!&#34;,

 &#34;Oh, I see.  You don&#39;t approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you &#34;
 &#34;somethin&#39;, Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds &#34;
 &#34;may be stacked against us, but we&#39;re gonna give it our best shot! And so, if &#34;
 &#34;you can&#39;t be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, &#34;
 &#34;Lexus. I&#39;m movin&#39; out of my parents&#39; house and I&#39;m movin&#39; in with you. Uh &#34;

 &#34;... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don&#39;t want to be &#34;
 &#39;together anymore?&#39;,
 &#34;So that&#39;s it? We&#39;re broken up now?&#34;,
 &#34;Well go ahead and go. It&#39;s best we don&#39;t say anything more. There&#39;s nothing &#34;

 &#34;Wuh-ell yeah, and I&#39;m sad, but at the same time I&#39;m really happy that &#34;
 &#34;somethin&#39; could make me feel that sad. It&#39;s like, ih ih, ih it makes me feel &#34;
 &#39;alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this &#39;
 &#34;sad now is if I felt somethin&#39; really good before. So I have to take the bad &#34;
 &#34;with the good, so I guess what I&#39;m feelin&#39; is like a, beautiful sadness. I &#34;

 &#39;Oh wow!&#39;,
 &#34;Yep. That&#39;s right. He&#39;s a real live robot. He can walk and talk and &#34;
 &#34;everything. You&#39;re like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go &#34;
 &#34;Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they&#39;re all so jealous!  &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You&#39;re the best friend a guy &#34;
 &#39;could have.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey yeah! Well I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, &#39;
 &#34;I have what&#39;s called a heziated colon, which means I sometime can&#39;t control &#34;
 &#39;my sphincter.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a &#39;
 &#39;diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It&#39;s a little suppository I &#34;
 &#39;have to ...put up my rectom.&#39;,
 &#34;Hm, okay. Let&#39;s see  Oh, my parents don&#39;t know, but sometimes I get picked &#34;
 &#39;on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries &#39;
 &#39;to play jokes on me and stuff.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me &#39;
 &#39;to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad &#39;
 &#39;and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.&#39;,
 &#34;No, he&#39;s not smart! He&#39;s just an asshole. And he&#39;s never gonna play on me &#34;
 &#39;ever again! &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, and he&#39;s never gonna get me again! &#39;Cause what Cartman doesn&#39;t know is &#34;
 &#39;that I know one of his secrets!&#39;,
 &#39;When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like &#39;
 &#34;Britney Spears and pretend he&#39;s her! Hi sings and dances around with a &#34;
 &#39;life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin &#34;
 &#39;Timberlake cutout!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I&#39;m gonna show that video to &#34;
 &#34;everybody! Then I&#39;ll lhave my revenge, boy howdy!&#34;,
 &#34;Huh? Oh, I dunno. It&#39;s around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do &#34;

 &#39;Mrs. Cartman?&#39;,
 &#39;This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, &#39;

 &#39;He says, he love you. &#39;,
 &#39;He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.&#39;,
 &#39;He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for &#39;
 &#39;granted.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he&#39;s, he&#39;s sorry for all the times he made &#34;
 &#34;fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He&#39;s asking for your forgiveness. &#34;
 &#39;And and he wants you to just remember the good times.&#39;,
 &#34;He can&#39;t! Don&#39;t you understand?!&#34;,
 &#39;God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!&#39;,
 &#39;Uhh all right then. &#39;,

 &#34;So I won&#39;t see you again?&#34;,

 &#39;Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at &#39;
 &#39;peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.&#39;,
 &#39;Did you ever do anything really bad?&#39;,
 &#39; Broke fence...&#39;,
 &#34;Boy oh boy, Eric, you&#39;ve got a lot to atone for.&#34;,
 &#34;Really. I mean, honestly, I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re gonna make up for all &#34;
 &#39;this.&#39;,
 &#39;Does this mean... you have to go now?&#39;,

 &#39;Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! &#39;,
 &#34;Ih ih it wasn&#39;t me! Ih it was the ghost!&#34;,

 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, he&#39;s sittin&#39; next to me right now.&#34;,

 &#34;What&#39;s... bi-curious?&#34;,
 &#34;Nothin&#39; Mom, I&#39;m just a little bicurious. &#34;,
 &#34;...Yeah, I&#39;m pretty confused alright.&#34;,
 &#39;Really?&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa boy! Camp!&#39;,
 &#34;Because I&#39;m bicurious?&#34;,

 &#39;Well sure, I guess.&#39;,

 &#34;Awww, that&#39;s okay, Bradley.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin&#39; all these verses, we won&#39;t be &#34;
 &#39;bicurious no more, and then we can go home!&#39;,
 &#34;Wuh-what&#39;s the matter?&#34;,
 &#39;Well I like you too, Bradley.&#39;,
 &#39;Wehyeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. &#39;,
 &#34; No! Bradley! You can&#39;t leave; you&#39;re my accountabilibuddy!&#34;,

 &#34;You&#39;re perfectly normal, Bradley.&#34;,
 &#39; All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling &#39;

 &#34;is Butters, I&#39;m eight years old, I&#39;m blood type O, and I&#39;m bicurious! And &#34;
 &#34;even that&#39;s okay! Because if I&#39;m bicurious, and I&#39;m somehow made from God, &#34;
 &#39;then I think your GOD must be a little bicurious himself! &#39;,
 &#34;No. I like bein&#39; bicurious.&#34;,

 &#39;imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists &#39;
 &#34;feel better? Maybe it&#39;s time for us all to just... get along.&#34;,
 &#34;Y-yeah, and that&#39;s not a heartfelt speech?&#34;,
 &#39; Hold on, fellas!&#39;,
 &#39;Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.&#39;,

 &#39;Huh... &#39;,

 &#39;That\&#39;s what I said. I told everyone outside, &#34;Cartman ain\&#39;t scared of &#39;
 &#39;fightin\&#39; Wendy! He\&#39;d do it if he could!&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;That way it won&#39;t matter if you get detention.&#34;,
 &#34;Man it&#39;s almost time for school to start an&#39; Wendy still isn&#39;t here.&#34;,
 &#39;Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!&#39;,
 &#39;She chickened out!&#39;,

 &#39;Hey, you fellas wanna see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from &#39;
 &#39;school are gonna see it again.&#39;,
 &#34;Why that&#39;s Bridon Güermo. He&#39;s just a third grader, but he can sing and &#34;
 &#39;dance better than anybody.&#39;,
 &#34;Awww jeez, you&#39;re no fun. &#34;,
 &#39;Here, you got the lead, Wendy. &#39;,
 &#34;No surprise there. It&#39;s Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! &#34;,
 &#39; Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s vampires in the school!&#34;,
 &#34;Vampires. I&#39;ve seen them.&#34;,
 &#34;Ugh.  Kenny, there&#39;s a vampire on the loose. Lynn Kitty Gelsa was hanging &#34;
 &#34;out with him, and now she&#39;s a vampire too!&#34;,
 &#39; But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but &#39;
 &#34;now it&#39;s like they&#39;re growing. They have fangs and drink blood and &#34;
 &#39;everything.&#39;,
 &#34;Really? Do you think that&#39;s best?&#34;,
 &#34;All right!  If I don&#39;t make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. &#34;,
 &#39; 12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a &#39;
 &#39;fifth grader.&#39;,
 &#39; Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s Ryan Ellis. Looks like they&#39;ve gotten to him too.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh God I think they&#39;re gonna drink blood now. They&#39;ve got some kind of &#34;
 &#34;chalice, and they&#39;re  uhn... &#34;,
 &#39; Stay back!  For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! &#39;
 &#39;The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!&#39;,
 &#34;Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin&#39;! You&#39;re not gonna believe it!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh no, what did I do this time?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh Jeez...&#39;,
 &#39;I have no idea, sir.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh, well I&#39;m sorry, Dad. Ih it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been really preoccupied &#34;
 &#39;lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-&#39;,
 &#39;A well-organized pantry.&#39;,
 &#34;Well okay, but Dad, you&#39;ve gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting &#34;
 &#34;to change. They&#39;ve been acting-&#34;,
 &#34; Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It&#39;s like nobody even cares &#34;
 &#34;if there&#39;s vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get &#34;
 &#39;hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do &#39;
 &#39;whatever they want. &#39;,
 &#34; Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I, I&#39;m Butters.&#34;,
 &#39;O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy &#39;
 &#39;darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you &#39;
 &#39;just, n, gi, well just give me the opportunity.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes! Yes, anything else?&#39;,
 &#34;Soda and Cheetos, yes. I&#39;ll be right back.&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve done what you&#39;ve asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who &#34;
 &#34;are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can&#39;t eat people food.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, I guess.&#39;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;m sick of bein&#39;- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. &#39;,
 &#39;I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!&#39;,
 &#34;You can&#39;t ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground &#34;
 &#39;that which is... ungroundable. &#39;,
 &#39;I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. &#39;,
 &#39;Sory, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human &#39;
 &#39;food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder &#39;
 &#34;which side I&#39;m supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn&#39;t matter. &#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t do it. A-hi, I can&#39;t do ihit!&#34;,
 &#34;What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn&#39;t have the stomach &#34;
 &#39;to be a vampire. I am so hungry.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Dad. &#39;,
 &#34;I have to eat! But I can&#39;t do it. I&#39;m getting weeeak.&#34;,
 &#39;Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!&#39;,
 &#34;Maybe not.  Did you say you&#39;re trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to &#34;
 &#39;help you.&#39;,
 &#34;Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires&#39; lair, the vampires go &#34;
 &#39;back to being human again.&#39;,
 &#39;I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into &#39;
 &#39;vampires. &#39;,
 &#39;Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re putting an end to it! &#34;,
 &#39; Mom, Dad!  I changed back!&#39;,
 &#39;Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I &#39;
 &#34;tried eatin&#39; a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out &#34;
 &#34;when I bit into it. I&#39;m human again!&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that, Dad?&#34;,
 &#39;Uh oh.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahh, dangit! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!&#39;,
 &#39; Well, apparently Kenny... has a girlfriend!&#39;,
 &#39;Udum, does Kenny like her?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no, oh Jeez!&#39;,
 &#39;Well I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is baaad news. All the fifth &#39;
 &#39;graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a BJ in &#39;
 &#39;the parking lot of TGI Fridays.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey Jimmy, what&#39;s a BJ?&#34;,
 &#39; Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut &#39;
 &#39;Tammy Warner.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh, what&#39;s that?&#34;,
 &#34; Huh... a ring that says you&#39;ll be together but not have sex... Isn&#39;t that &#34;
 &#39;called a wedding ring? &#39;,
 &#39; Hi, Grandma!&#39;,
 &#34;Well,  why are we wearin&#39; bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;Well Eric did. &#39;,
 &#34;Well don&#39;t worry Kyle. We&#39;re not gonna let people kill you. We&#39;ll keep you &#34;
 &#39;hidden forever!&#39;,
 &#34;The day they&#39;re showin&#39; Part 2 of last week&#39;s Terrance and Phillip show!&#34;,

 &#34;They didn&#39;t show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the &#34;
 &#39;Queef Sisters!&#39;,
 &#39; Robbed us of our innocence... &#39;,
 &#39;Oh God, oh my God no! &#39;,
 &#39;Ohhhhh Ohhhhh. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Hey fellas.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw thanks.&#39;,
 &#39;Ohhhhh Ohhhhh!&#39;,
 &#39;My, my picture?&#39;,
 &#34;Ohoho, there&#39;s Clyde. Do it to Clyde.&#34;,
 &#39;Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.&#39;,
 &#39; HA you saiid you like fishstcks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! &#39;,
 &#34;Hey look, there&#39;s Kevin Stolle!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks?? &#34;,
 &#39; Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.&#39;,
 &#39;Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! &#39;,
 &#39;We can?&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa.&#39;,
 &#39;Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives &#39;
 &#39;behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to &#39;
 &#39;Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Neato!&#39;,
 &#39;Pirates ho! &#39;,
 &#34; Oh jeez. Unh I don&#39;t know if I can really go through with this.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s just l-leavin&#39; everything behind, uh, uh I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually &#34;
 &#39;doing it.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh, who, you mean you?&#39;,
 &#34;No, I&#39;m sick of it!&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s right, lads. To adventure!&#34;,
 &#34;Where&#39;s all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?&#34;,
 &#39;Uhh,  mahjey burazi?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh. He-he says they&#39;re in there. &#34;,
 &#39;ARRRRRRGH!&#39;,
 &#39;Okay! &#39;,
 &#39;Have a good day! &#39;,
 &#39; What\&#39;s &#34;port&#34;?!&#39;,
 &#39;One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, &#39;cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and &#34;
 &#39;homework.&#39;,
 &#39;And our parents hollered at us!&#39;,
 &#39;So we wanted to come here and be pirates.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, me too.&#39;,
 &#39; Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.&#39;,
 &#34;Me and Ike, well, we&#39;ve been talkin&#39; and, well guys, we really had it pretty &#34;
 &#34;good back in America. I mean, sure, it&#39;s easy to think our lives are boring &#34;
 &#34;and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate&#39;s life &#34;
 &#34;isn&#39;t a life of fun and adventure, it&#39;s a life of hardship and suffering. &#34;
 &#39;When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we &#39;
 &#39;did. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a dork, and I deserve what&#39;s coming to me.  Ow.&#34;,
 &#39;Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! &#39;,
 &#39;Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.&#39;,
 &#39;Uugh!&#39;,
 &#34;So what??  So I&#39;m almost nine years old and anyone who hasn&#39;t kissed a girl &#34;
 &#39;by fourth grade is a dork!&#39;,
 &#34;Sellin&#39; kisses?&#34;,
 &#34;You mean I&#39;m... gonna kiss a girl... today?&#34;,
 &#39;Oh boy, I sure am nervous.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh how come?&#39;,
 &#39;I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.&#34;,
 &#39;So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopinnn maybe I could get a kiss.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. &#39;,
 &#39;Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. &#39;,
 &#39;Thank you! &#39;,
 &#34; Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I&#39;m a man now.  Jeez, I&#39;m gonna start havin&#39; &#34;
 &#34;lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin&#39; about a career. &#34;
 &#34;There&#39;s gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play &#34;
 &#39;time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a &#39;
 &#39;way to make money.  Hey, I know.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin&#39; kisses? &#39;Cause I know a girl &#34;
 &#34;that&#39;ll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!&#34;,
 &#39;Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!&#39;,
 &#34; Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I&#39;ve been thinkin&#39;, Sally: I could probably &#34;
 &#39;drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. &#39;
 &#39;We could make double the money.&#39;,
 &#39;Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to &#39;
 &#39;fill in for you sometimes?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all &#39;
 &#39;our money together.&#39;,
 &#34;We could have our very own...  kissin&#39; company.&#34;,
 &#39;The next key to a successful business is &#34;innovation.&#34; I think maybe we need &#39;
 &#34;to understand that some boys simply can&#39;t afford the five dollars for a &#34;
 &#39;kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?&#39;,
 &#39;Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess &#39;
 &#34;is perfect. Megan, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; about moving you to the baseball field after &#34;
 &#39;school during little league practice.&#39;,
 &#34;I got a kissing booth set up at the kids&#39; fair on Saturday so Kayla and &#34;
 &#39;Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses &#39;
 &#34;gets  a little sunshine, but if you don&#39;t show up for work at all, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;afraid you get a storny cloud.&#39;,
 &#34;Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We&#39;re offerin&#39; two for one kisses &#34;
 &#39;today through Thursday.&#39;,
 &#39;Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at &#39;
 &#39;this. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya guys, this is the most genius idea I&#39;ve ever come up with. A &#34;
 &#39;lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.&#39;,
 &#39;...A pimp. Huh...&#39;,
 &#34;Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There&#39;s guys with kissing companies all over &#34;
 &#39;the country. &#34;The person managing all the women is known as the \&#39;pimp,\&#39; &#39;
 &#39;while the working women are referred to as \&#39;ho\&#39; or \&#39;bitch.\&#39;&#34; Oh, you\&#39;re &#39;
 &#39;a bitch, Sally. &#39;,
 &#34;Hey, look at this!There&#39;s about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. &#34;
 &#39;I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for &#39;
 &#39;our company.&#39;,
 &#39; Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, &#39;
 &#34;I&#39;m just starting out. I really came last minute &#39;cause I&#39;m hoping to learn &#34;
 &#39;more about being a successful pimp&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel &#39;
 &#39;like I could be doing a better job.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s the game?&#34;,
 &#34; Yes I I know what you are saying. You don&#39;t have to keep asking.&#34;,
 &#34;I know what you&#39;re saying.&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Dad!&#39;,
 &#34;Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally&#39;s just my bottom bitch.  You &#34;
 &#39;know what I am saying? &#39;,
 &#39;Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. &#39;
 &#34;Except for you, Megan, I&#39;m afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.&#34;,
 &#34;I just hold on to all the money, &#39;cause bitches can&#39;t be trusted with it. We &#34;
 &#39;pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you &#39;
 &#39;just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. &#39;
 &#39;Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?&#39;,
 &#39; Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.&#39;,
 &#34;Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin&#39; money?&#34;,
 &#34;Bitch you should be doin&#39; kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks &#34;
 &#34;a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you&#39;ve ever wanted. I&#39;ll treat you &#34;
 &#39;right, bitch.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don&#39;t you wanna start makin&#39; &#34;
 &#34;some real fuckin&#39; money?&#34;,
 &#39;Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there &#39;
 &#34;workin&#39;. Don&#39;t you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that &#34;
 &#39;for you, bitch.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh. Well all I&#39;m sayin&#39; the bitch should be out there workin&#39; is all.  &#34;
 &#34;Whatcha doin&#39; bitch? Just givin&#39; kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be &#34;
 &#34;makin&#39; some motherfuckin&#39; money!&#34;,
 &#34; Clyde, here&#39;s a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.&#34;,
 &#34;Come on Wendy, you should be puttin&#39; that mouth to work.&#34;,
 &#34;All these bitches are kissin&#39; fellers, and they haven&#39;t figured out that &#34;
 &#34;they can be making some serious fuckin&#39; money!&#34;,
 &#34;Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you&#39;re chargin&#39; &#34;
 &#39;five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright &#39;
 &#39;bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! &#39;,
 &#39;Sure, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#34;a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you&#39;re paying for it. You&#39;ve &#34;
 &#39;gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time &#39;
 &#34;listenin&#39; to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  Why &#34;
 &#34;he&#39;s gotta sit there and lsiten to her stupid motherfuckin&#39; problems &#39;cause &#34;
 &#34;she kisses him. If you ask me, that&#39;s a lot more than the five dollars my &#34;
 &#39;company charges.&#39;,
 &#34;What happened is that I became a man! I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not your littel buddy &#34;
 &#34;anymore, but there&#39;s a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am &#34;
 &#39;saying?! &#39;,
 &#34;And that&#39;s... three thousand dollars today for Charise. &#34;,
 &#39;REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.&#39;,
 &#39; Mmmwhoa boy!&#39;,
 &#39;And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for &#39;
 &#39;some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing &#39;
 &#39;under.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a kissing company.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two &#39;
 &#39;thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars &#39;
 &#34;just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, &#39;cause a lot of &#34;
 &#34;her customers see her late.  You wouldn&#39;t believe the time of night some &#34;
 &#39;fellers wanna kiss.&#39;,
 &#34;&#39;Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially &#34;
 &#39;the VIPs, like Senator Morris.&#39;,
 &#39;Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he &#39;
 &#39;likes to get kissed?&#39;,
 &#39;In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh? Why?&#39;,
 &#39;But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!&#39;,
 &#39;Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley down in &#39;
 &#39;Ziglar. &#39;,
 &#39;Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for twooo housing loans aaand &#39;
 &#39;tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.&#39;,
 &#39; Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to &#39;
 &#39;Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;,
 &#34;Well wait, hold on now. Why I&#39;d never get in the way of somebody being &#34;
 &#39;happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.&#39;,
 &#39;Wha? Awww.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. &#39;,
 &#39;Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a &#39;
 &#34;knee.  Gals I... well I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do this anymore. I&#39;m gonna be &#34;
 &#34;leavin&#39; the company. Well I enjoyed being yoru pimp and all, it&#39;s just &#34;
 &#39;that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it &#39;
 &#39;just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but &#39;
 &#34;it doesn&#39;t mean I have the right to be earnin&#39; money for what girls do, &#34;
 &#34;whether you&#39;re chargin&#39; fellers for kisses by cash or by makin&#39; them listen &#34;
 &#34;to your stupid motherfuckin&#39; problems. Well that&#39;s your hard work. Bitches, &#34;
 &#39;this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some &#39;
 &#34;motherfuckin&#39; money!&#34;,
 &#39;Yes! Yehhehehes!&#39;,
 &#39;Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s do this!&#34;,
 &#39;Triceratops!&#39;,
 &#39;I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! &#39;,
 &#39;Okey doke.&#39;,
 &#39;Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey! No! No, the fight hasn&#39;t started yet. No fair.&#34;,
 &#39;Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;No way!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m freaking out...&#34;,
 &#39;Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you &#39;
 &#39;going to run from that as well?&#39;,
 &#39;No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years &#34;
 &#34;ago survived! And he&#39;s here now!&#34;,
 &#39;Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!&#39;,
 &#39; Are you sure?&#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s closer to a panther than you&#39;ll ever be!&#34;,
 &#39;Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who caer about the Japanese &#39;
 &#34;slaughterin&#39; whales.&#34;,
 &#34;Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there&#39;s these fellers &#34;
 &#34;on TV. They go out in the ocena an&#39; try to stop the Japanese wherever they &#34;
 &#39;are.&#39;,
 &#39;I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.&#39;,
 &#34;What are you guys talkin&#39; about? Harleys are neato!&#34;,
 &#34;I always thought, someday when I grow up I&#39;m gonna get a Harley. Then people &#34;
 &#34;will have to notice me, and they&#39;ll have to deal with MY shit for once. The &#34;
 &#34;open road! The wind on my face! I&#39;ll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! &#34;
 &#39;Everyone lookin\&#39; at me! &#34;Who\&#39;s that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be &#39;
 &#39;tough!&#34; Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I\&#39;ll have my girl on the back seat &#39;
 &#34;holdin&#39; on to my fat belly - sure she&#39;s missin&#39; a few teeth, but she thinks &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m coool. That&#39;s why, when I grow up, I&#39;m gonna be a Harley rider!&#34;,
 &#39;It does?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay. &#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s because you guys NEVER understood!  You fellers never got what these &#34;
 &#39;people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living &#39;
 &#39;image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an &#39;
 &#39;All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh jeez!&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?&#39;,
 &#39;That you hate Smurfs?&#39;,
 &#39;Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!&#39;,
 &#39; It IS true!&#39;,
 &#39;What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a &#39;
 &#39;bitch.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey Eric!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president &#39;
 &#34;never does anything, and how she&#39;s changing everything?&#34;,
 &#39;Cool, thanks.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, okay. &#39;,
 &#39; Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!&#39;,
 &#39;Whoa... &#39;,
 &#39;That doesn it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!&#39;,
 &#39;We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to &#39;
 &#39;meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally &#39;
 &#39;stand up to Wendy Testaburger!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know about all of you, but I have had enough! We&#39;ve been sitting &#34;
 &#39;back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we &#39;
 &#34;do something about it!  So let&#39;s march right over there to Wendy&#39;s house and &#34;
 &#39;do what we know needs to be done! &#39;,
 &#39;Let us not forget what happens this day!&#39;,
 &#39;We are here, Wendy Testaburger! &#39;,
 &#39;I am.&#39;,
 &#34;The students wants answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you&#39;ve got &#34;
 &#39;nothing to hide!&#39;,
 &#39;Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!&#39;,
 &#34;Ohhh, he&#39;s got her now!&#34;,
 &#34;She&#39;s speechless!&#34;,
 &#34;All right! Cartman&#39;s president. We did it.&#34;,
 &#39;What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.&#39;,
 &#34; Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I&#39;ve gotta go to the bathroom. &#34;,
 &#39;Okay, thanks. &#39;,
 &#39;You said &#34;go ahead&#34;.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, come on, Kyle, I&#39;m not the only person who&#39;s peed in the pool. Lots of &#34;
 &#39;people do.&#39;,
 &#39;You bet!&#39;,
 &#39;The who?&#39;,
 &#39;Whoopie! &#39;,
 &#34;Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin&#39; up again!&#34;,
 &#39;Come on, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! &#39;,
 &#39;Do you need to wash your hands?&#39;,
 &#39;You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#39;Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.&#39;,
 &#39;Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.&#39;,
 &#39;You can do it, Kyle!&#39;,
 &#39; Hey look! &#39;,
 &#39;Hawww, you lived?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s this?&#34;,
 &#34;Holy moly, what&#39;s that between the lady&#39;s legs? It&#39;s all bushy.&#34;,
 &#34; I&#39;ve never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do &#34;
 &#39;they??&#39;,
 &#39; Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??&#39;,
 &#39;Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no!&#39;,
 &#39;It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh no. I don&#39;t wanna have to buy a Batman costume.&#34;,
 &#39;There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but &#39;
 &#34;smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should&#39;ve been. If I &#34;
 &#34;trim it down, it&#39;ll look right..&#34;,
 &#39; But this is what I keep seeing in my head!&#39;,
 &#34; No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;,
 &#39;Haah! Leave me alone! &#39;,
 &#34;Me, I just... Well I jsut can&#39;t stop thinking about bush.&#34;,
 &#34;I mean it&#39;s like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush &#34;
 &#39;right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh good, &#39;cause I really can&#39;t take it anymore.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady &#39;
 &#34;to show me hers. You wanna know what&#39;s under thta bush? Nothin&#39; but a pair &#34;
 &#39;of sick Joker lips.&#39;,
 &#39;Kill John Lennon...  Kill Joh Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John &#39;
 &#39;Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?&#39;,
 &#39; Aww. Dangit. &#39;,
 &#34;Oh hey fellas. I&#39;m just watching the Kardashians&#34;,
 &#39;Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.&#39;,
 &#39;I am?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh no. Which book was that?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read &#34;
 &#39;&#34;Catcher In The Rye&#34; I\&#39;ve been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of &#39;
 &#39;wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark &#39;
 &#39;writings in my sleep!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh, thanks.&#39;,
 &#39;I wrote that. &#39;,
 &#39;Thank you! &#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s nice. &#34;,
 &#39;Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?&#39;,
 &#39;But, you told me I did!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m broooding.&#34;,
 &#34;No, let me tell you somethin&#39;, fellers! You always take advantage of me, and &#34;
 &#39;after reading &#34;Catcher in the Rye,&#34; I\&#39;ve learned you\&#39;re nothing but &#39;
 &#34;phonies! I&#39;m not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just &#34;
 &#39;suck on my wiener!&#39;,
 &#39;I have to come right to my room after school.&#39;,
 &#34;Not yet, but as soon as I&#39;m not grounded anymore, I&#39;m hopin&#39; to meet Kim &#34;
 &#39;Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.&#39;,
 &#39;Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, is that who the book was tellin&#39; me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  &#34;
 &#39;Kill Ronald Reagan.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, it&#39;s kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human &#34;
 &#39;mind!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh it&#39;s raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I&#39;m going to &#34;
 &#39;deliver!&#39;,
 &#34;Sorry Dad, I was just bein&#39; the voice of a generation. &#34;,
 &#39;I know.&#39;,
 &#39; You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the &#39;
 &#39;world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!&#39;,
 &#34;Thang, thanks, fellas. I&#39;ll definitely never write again. I think I can get &#34;
 &#39;over this.&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39;What?! Oh no!&#39;,
 &#39;Aw. Aw I got her killed too?? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. &#39;,
 &#34; Hey Stan, isn&#39;t that Tom Cruise?&#34;,
 &#34;How come you&#39;re packin&#39; fudge, Mr. Cruise?&#34;,
 &#34; Why I, I just don&#39;t wanna watch him kill himself... I don&#39;t even know who &#34;
 &#39;he is anymore!&#39;,
 &#39; The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he &#39;
 &#39;liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then &#39;
 &#34;Towelie just kept gettin&#39; more and more high, and he got kicked out of the &#34;
 &#39;house.&#39;,
 &#34; I really think this intervention is Towelie&#39;s last chance.  Towelie! Open &#34;
 &#39;the door!&#39;,
 &#39;Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!&#39;,
 &#34;Um come on, Towelie, it&#39;s, it&#39;s right over here.&#34;,
 &#39; Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect &#39;
 &#39;you in the following ways.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and &#34;
 &#39;absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest &#39;
 &#39;amount of water. Will you get help today?&#39;,
 &#34; Towelie! We aren&#39;t the only ones in this intervention who&#39;ve been hurt by &#34;
 &#39;you!&#39;,
 &#39;He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. &#39;,
 &#39;You will?&#39;,

 &#39; Boy, I\&#39;ve really done it this time. I have one simple direction: &#34;Go that &#39;
 &#39;way.&#34; How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy &#39;
 &#34;Meheecan. They&#39;re all living the good life while I&#39;m, while I&#39;m stuck out &#34;
 &#39;here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.&#39;,

 &#39;So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made &#39;

 &#34;I might have froze to death. But I&#39;m not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! &#34;,

 &#34;apparently it&#39;s all gonna be finalized soon.&#34;,
 &#39;Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? &#39;,
 &#39;Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.&#39;,
 &#39;Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is &#39;
 &#39;unfair.&#39;,
 &#39;Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.&#39;,
 &#39;I sure hope this works.&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh neato, huh fellas?&#39;,
 &#39; Thanksgiving is about murder?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay Dad.&#39;,
 &#39;Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to &#39;
 &#39;see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.&#39;,
 &#39;So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches &#39;
 &#34;with the tax records of people in town to see which kids&#39; parents actually &#34;
 &#39;made the least amount of money last year.&#39;,
 &#34;Well actually, Eric, it&#39;s you. &#34;,
 &#34;Now that Kenny&#39;s gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;sorry pal.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh I won&#39;t tell anybody.&#34;,

 &#39;Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! &#39;,
 &#39; Yes...&#39;,
 &#39;Trapped inside the darkness of my mind. I try to break free. The words are &#39;
 &#39;so unkind.&#39;,
 &#34;Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don&#39;t wanna do this.&#34;,
 &#39;Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.&#39;,

 &#34;No it doesn&#39;t.&#34;,
 &#39;Stop it!&#39;,
 &#39;Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean &#39;
 &#34;and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can&#39;t lie, it felt kind of good. At &#34;
 &#39;first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. &#39;
 &#34;Then I realized... that&#39;s how you must feel. All the time. Poor old Grandma. &#34;
 &#34;You know, I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been gettin&#39; lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand &#34;
 &#34;up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there&#39;s just people like you &#34;
 &#34;out there. All over the place. When you&#39;re a kid, things seem like they&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;gonna last forever. But they&#39;re not. Life changes. Why you won&#39;t always be &#34;
 &#34;around. Someday you&#39;re gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you&#39;re &#34;
 &#34;layin&#39; in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan &#34;
 &#34;under your butt to pee in, well I&#39;ll come visit ya. I&#39;ll come just to show &#34;
 &#34;you that, that I&#39;m still alive and I&#39;m still happy. And you&#39;ll die. Bein&#39; &#34;
 &#34;nothin&#39; but you.  &#39;Night Grandma. &#34;,
 &#39; Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!&#39;,
 &#39; Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!&#39;,
 &#39; Guess!&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s a new girl that started school here today. And she&#39;s joined the &#34;
 &#39;cheerleading squad.&#39;,
 &#39;Theh theh, there she is. &#39;,
 &#39;How come?&#39;,
 &#34;Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren&#39;t meant for each other.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys&#39; locker room. &#34;,
 &#39; It;s gonna be okay, Eric.&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;ll find love osmewhere else.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes they will.&#39;,
 &#39;Ih in who, Eric?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh, I just don&#39;t get football. Guess that&#39;s why I suck at it.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;so good at sucking.&#39;,
 &#39;I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?&#39;,
 &#39;Okay!  Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. &#39;
 &#39;Wow, this game is great!&#39;,
 &#34;Hey, whoa! Well I can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m hearing!  We&#39;ve been practicing and &#34;
 &#34;gettin&#39; ready for htis game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!&#34;,
 &#34;This great game isn&#39;t about plays. It&#39;s about sportsmanship. And compassion. &#34;
 &#39;And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most &#39;
 &#34;compassionate guys I&#39;ve ever met!  Well Token, you&#39;re nicer than anybody I &#34;
 &#39;know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!&#39;,
 &#39;Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think &#39;
 &#34;they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein&#39; nice is about what&#39;s inside you! &#34;
 &#39;When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they &#39;
 &#39;give you two balloons, well you give them three!&#39;,
 &#39;And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say &#34;Ah I don\&#39;t &#39;
 &#39;need any thanks! I did it \&#39;cause it was the right thing to do!&#34; And then &#39;
 &#39;you give them a smile!&#39;,
 &#34;And when that other team tries to cover you, well that&#39;s when you gotta &#34;
 &#39;reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well &#39;
 &#34;that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin&#39; goo sits &#34;
 &#39;and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;ve ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!&#34;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh jeez n-no, I I don&#39;t know, fellas.&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, but I uh, I I can&#39;t be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.&#34;,
 &#34; &#39;At&#39;s in there. It&#39;s overflowing sometimes. &#34;,
 &#39; I love you too, ladies. &#39;,
 &#39;Woohoohoohoohoo!&#39;,
 &#39;Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of &#39;
 &#39;my creamy goo came out. &#39;,
 &#34; I was havin&#39; happy dreams, about a girl and-!&#34;,
 &#39;Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. &#39;,
 &#39;Wuh sure, Eric. &#39;,
 &#34;Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you&#39;re, why you&#39;re a great player.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, &#39;
 &#34;where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn&#39;t your dad &#34;
 &#39;ever tell you that?&#39;,
 &#34;...Oh right, I, I&#39;m sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And &#34;
 &#39;and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out &#39;
 &#34;sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I&#39;ve had &#34;
 &#39;them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, &#39;
 &#39;and when I wake up, I I realize somem of my goo has come out.  But I always &#39;
 &#39;make sure I keep it, just in case I ever sun out of all my sunshine happy &#39;
 &#39;feelings.&#39;,
 &#34;My goo doesn&#39;t come out every night, but I suer seem to have a surplus of &#34;
 &#39;it. &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. &#34;,
 &#39;Do you feel warm and compassionate?&#39;,
 &#39;Alright, first string, cover those wide outs tell them how much you like &#39;

 &#34;gotta shoot your mouth off like you&#39;re the frickin&#39; expert! Well you don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire &#39;
 &#39;planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys &#39;
 &#34;think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You&#39;re all &#34;
 &#39;fake and stuck up  and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his &#39;
 &#34;jokes aren&#39;t funny!  The only kid who has any sense of dignity is Kenny, and &#34;
 &#39;the rest of you have your heads up your butts! &#39;,
 &#34; And that&#39;s another thing!! You&#39;re always trivializing everything I say by &#34;

 &#34;We&#39;re frmo Hawaii?&#34;,
 &#39;But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on &#39;
 &#39;her period?&#39;,
 &#34;They won&#39;t let me on the plane. Why, I can&#39;t do anything right!  No, no! I &#34;

 &#34;Uh yeah, I uh, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m supposed to go?&#34;,
 &#34;Oh, ah, I&#39;m not a tourist. I&#39;m a native Hawaiian. &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh please, i-if it weren&#39;t for him I couldn&#39;t have come.&#34;,
 &#39;You folks are all native Hawaiians too?&#39;,
 &#39;What\&#39;s &#34;saimin&#34;?&#39;,
 &#34; Whoa, it&#39;s like gasoline!&#34;,
 &#39; Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve never done this before. &#34;,
 &#39;My anger... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! &#39;,
 &#34; No! Kenny&#39;s my friend! He&#39;s the only kid at school I actually like, you &#34;
 &#39;buncha jerks!&#39;,
 &#34;He won&#39;t betray us! Will you, Kenny?!&#34;,
 &#39;Kenny, be careful!&#39;,
 &#39;Kenny!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I don&#39;t know about the rest of ya, but I&#39;m sick and tired of bein&#39; &#34;
 &#39;pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa &#39;
 &#34;ceremony, and I can&#39;t even have it, &#39;cause the fucking haoles have to roin &#34;
 &#39;everything!&#39;,
 &#34;Well if you ask me, the only good haole&#39;s a dead haole! With a, with a, &#34;
 &#39;stick, right up his butthole and uh, and his wiener cut off! Aaagh! &#39;,
 &#39; Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!&#39;,
 &#39; Surrender?! No, the heck with that!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I won&#39;t do it, you hear me?! I&#39;m not licking anybody&#39;s... testes!&#34;,
 &#34;No! This is our home! And I&#39;m sick of everyone who thinks they&#39;re better &#34;
 &#34;than me just &#39;cause they&#39;ve got good looks, and just &#39;cause, even after &#34;
 &#39;massacreing Daverdevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that &#39;
 &#34;everyone loves! You shouldn&#39;t be able to be good-looking and be with &#34;
 &#39;Jennifer Lopez AND be a good director!  Alright alright fine! Argo is a good &#39;
 &#34;movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn&#39;t hold up, but it &#34;
 &#39;helds up goddarnit! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn&#39;t change the fact that Ben Affleck &#34;
 &#39;gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer &#39;
 &#39;Lopez.&#39;,
 &#34;What?? Really?? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He&#39;s just &#34;
 &#39;married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. &#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He&#39;s a good filmmaker. Come on, &#34;
 &#39;Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, &#39;
 &#34;Kenny? It&#39;s a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin&#39; for him. Not &#34;
 &#39;everything, but a lot. Whoopie!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don&#39;t have costumes?&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that&#39;s been bitten by a werewolf. &#34;
 &#34;And Jimmy&#39;s Gangnam Style.&#34;,
 &#34;Come on! What are you guys goin&#39; as??&#34;,
 &#34;That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I&#39;m a wereprechaun. You &#34;

 &#39;Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. &#39;,
 &#34;Kyle Kyle! It&#39;s Stan! He&#39;s dying. &#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, &#34;Well, what about the New &#39;
 &#39;Testament?&#34;&#39;,
 &#39;And he says, &#34;Well you still should oughta read it, but you\&#39;re gonna need &#39;
 &#39;to put an sterisk next to Jesus\&#39; name whenever it comes up.&#34;&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, Stan. Didn&#39;t you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?&#34;,
 &#39; Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! &#39;,
 &#34;Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn&#39;t back down amymore when I &#34;
 &#39;feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did &#39;
 &#39;for all those farmers in Belarus. &#39;,
 &#39;I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. &#39;,
 &#34;He&#39;s the one person who doesn&#39;t do stuff like that! Why don&#39;t you leave him &#34;

 &#39;all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed &#39;
 &#39;lighth on the Belarusian farmers.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeeah. Is it true?&#39;,
 &#39;Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think &#39;

 &#39;Wu-what sound?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.&#39;,
 &#39;Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?&#39;,
 &#34;He didn&#39;t tell me nothin&#39;. Annd I&#39;m sworn to secrecy. Ih-it&#39;s really &#34;

 &#39;You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had &#39;
 &#39;anythingn to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, there&#39;s a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There&#39;s even some &#34;
 &#39;quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to &#39;
 &#39;forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.&#39;,
 &#34;Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don&#39;t think I really &#34;
 &#39;followed all that.&#39;,
 &#39;Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?&#39;,
 &#34; I can&#39;t think of anywhere I&#39;d rather be than at the DMV with all you &#34;
 &#34;wonderful people. Now let&#39;s all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.&#34;,
 &#39;Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s time to let go, Eric. Don&#39;t you see there&#39;s no other way? Just let the &#34;
 &#39;government into your heart.&#39;,
 &#34; It&#39;s never too late. There&#39;s a place where you can start over. &#34;,
 &#34;Your government doesn&#39;t listen in on you to punish you, your government just &#34;
 &#39;wants you to be honest about your mistakes.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.&#39;,
 &#39;Yes!&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!&#34;,
 &#39;Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!&#39;,
 &#39;Halleluyah!&#39;,
 &#39;Murder porn?&#39;,
 &#39;I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know &#39;
 &#34;what they told me?! They told me if I didn&#39;t want my parents watchin&#39;, then &#34;
 &#34;I should spend more time with them! Like it&#39;s my fault!&#34;,
 &#39; I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was &#39;
 &#34;harvesting sugarcane. It didn&#39;t make any sense because he was trying to &#34;
 &#39;harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I swa him take my mom up to the top of &#39;
 &#39;this big... thing he had built, and he yalled &#34;Hey, watch out for the &#39;
 &#39;griefers&#34; but she fell!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. And then my dad just went berzerk and came over and picked me up and &#39;
 &#39;threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!&#39;,
 &#39;I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my &#39;
 &#39;dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! &#39;
 &#39;Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!&#39;,
 &#39;Huh?&#39;,
 &#39;Yes.&#39;,
 &#39;Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!&#39;,
 &#39;Holy Moly&#39;,
 &#39;Heheh, yeah. &#39;,
 &#39;Whoa, look at it!&#39;,
 &#39;Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s go get the kindergartners. Uh they&#39;re gonna wanna see this too! &#34;,
 &#34;Hohoh! What&#39;d you do, Kyle?&#34;,
 &#39;Busted!&#39;,
 &#39;Just stop, please.&#39;,
 &#39;Woo, spooky.&#39;,
 &#39; Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! &#39;,
 &#34; Uh, sorry, I haven&#39;t watched it yet.&#34;,
 &#39;Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.&#39;,
 &#34;Well it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost &#34;
 &#34;every time they show a guy&#39;s wiener, that guy&#39;s character is gay?&#34;,
 &#34;Well ih-it&#39;s just that they have a lot of girls&#39; boobs andn vaginas and &#34;
 &#34;stuff, but most times they show a man&#39;s wiener, it&#39;s because that guy&#39;s in a &#34;
 &#34;love scene with another guy. Do you think it&#39;s because gay wieners are less &#34;
 &#39;threatening to women viewers?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, I know. Winter is comin&#39; and there&#39;s dragons and zombies on the way. &#34;
 &#34;I&#39;m pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is &#34;
 &#39;all.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh don&#39;t even get me started! I keep watchin&#39; that show and I&#39;m waitin&#39; for &#34;
 &#34;the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone&#39;s butt! But all I get is &#34;
 &#34;wiener, wiener, wiener. It&#39;s not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a &#34;
 &#34;straight guy&#39;s wiener, it&#39;s all soft and floppy. Even though he just got &#34;
 &#34;done humpin&#39; a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;threatening, just like a gay wiener. &#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m obsessed wtih wieners? Well what about HBO?&#34;,
 &#39; Yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;You mean Princess Kenny, m&#39;lord?&#34;,
 &#34;They don&#39;t!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah, I finished it!&#39;,
 &#39;Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising &#39;
 &#39;dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!&#39;,
 &#39;Wha-what do you want me to do?&#39;,
 &#34;Who&#39;s George R. R. Martin?&#34;,
 &#34;Well come on, Scott. You&#39;re lagging.&#34;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald&#39;s. Oh here we &#34;
 &#39;go. 2217. &#39;,
 &#34;Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin&#39;s house?&#34;,
 &#34;Uhhhh, it&#39;s two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show &#34;
 &#39;up?  Hello?&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re not fans!&#34;,
 &#34;We don&#39;t like it! And I&#39;m pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!&#34;,
 &#34;Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I&#39;ll tell him about what! &#34;,
 &#39;Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never &#39;
 &#39;seem to show up.&#39;,
 &#39;When?&#39;,
 &#34; Please. It&#39;s urgent.&#34;,
 &#39;No, uhno, can we skip the wienre stuff and just get to the dragons?&#39;,
 &#34;Uh what&#39;s the matter, Scott?&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s diabetic.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh. Okay, thanks.&#39;,
 &#39;OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!&#39;,
 &#39;But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! &#39;,
 &#34; Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don&#39;t show &#34;
 &#34;up right now, you&#39;re gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!&#34;,
 &#39;What kind do we want?!&#39;,
 &#34;Come on, Scott! We&#39;re leaving! &#34;,
 &#39;NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the &#39;
 &#39;first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!&#39;,
 &#39;Whatoyou mean?&#39;,
 &#34;Now just hold on a minute! Well I&#39;m pretty darned sure the fastest way back &#34;
 &#34;to Colorado isn&#39;t on horseback!&#34;,
 &#34;What&#39;s that?  Awww! &#34;,
 &#39;Hey, fellas. What did I miss? &#39;,
 &#39;The graphics are defintely like 10% better than the old XBox.&#39;,
 &#34; Yeah, and if you believe that I&#39;ve got a big floppy wiener to dangle in &#34;
 &#39;your face!&#39;,
 &#39;So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady &#39;
 &#39;takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says &#34;I&#34;-&#39;,
 &#39; Oh. Yes?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but &#39;
 &#34;you&#39;re too fat for me.&#34;,
 &#39;See ya, Lisa! &#39;,
 &#34;Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da.  Camptown racetrack&#39;s five &#34;
 &#39;miles long Oh, de doo-da day. Oh-&#39;,
 &#39;Oh. Hey Wendy.&#39;,

 &#34;Well, m-no. I&#39;ve got arms and legs; I&#39;ve got everything.&#34;,
 &#34;Ah I think she&#39;s a nice girl too. She&#39;s just too big for me.&#34;,
 &#39;Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my &#34;
 &#39;women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, &#39;
 &#34;who&#39;s got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect &#34;
 &#39;ehhverything.&#39;,
 &#34;You&#39;re a liar!&#34;,
 &#34;You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she&#39;s a &#34;
 &#39;hobbit!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, she said it again!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh no you don&#39;t, Wendy! You&#39;re not trappin&#39; me inside the computer lab to &#34;
 &#39;beat me up!&#39;,
 &#34;Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I&#39;ll scream! &#34;,
 &#39;Okay.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s Lisa Berger??&#34;,
 &#34;She&#39;s pretty!&#34;,
 &#39;Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me??&#39;,
 &#39;And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers &#39;
 &#39;and then go tell her I love her. &#39;,
 &#39;Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen &#39;
 &#39;Lisa Berger anywhere?&#39;,
 &#34;II know! I&#39;m gonna tell her I love her, and we&#39;re gonna be together and be &#34;
 &#39;happy forever.&#39;,
 &#39;What?? Well since when?&#39;,
 &#34;No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She&#39;s built like a Slim Jim! &#34;,
 &#39;I do love water balloons. &#39;,
 &#39; Rotten boobie turds!&#39;,
 &#39;Man this sucks!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;re sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names &#34;

 &#39; We already got a dollar!&#39;,
 &#39;One dollar pledge!&#39;,
 &#39;Another two dollars!&#39;,
 &#39; Washington Redsking. Go fuck youself.&#39;,

 &#34;Hang on, is this the company where I don&#39;t get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? &#34;
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;m uh stayin&#39; here.&#34;,
 &#39;Happy Deadline Day!&#39;,
 &#39;Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!&#34;,
 &#39;Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!&#39;,
 &#39;Somebody killed Kickstarter!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It&#39;ll be like old times!&#34;,
 &#39;We finally did it!&#39;,
 &#34; Hey Eric! I&#39;m not suspended no more.&#34;,
 &#34; I think someone&#39;s in there.&#34;,
 &#34;That&#39;s Cartman&#39;s new transgender bathroom.&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not a woman, he&#39;s not a man, he is something that you&#39;ll never &#34;
 &#39;understand. But he would die for me. &#39;,
 &#39;Holy moly! &#39;,
 &#39; Hey! Everything okay, Stan?&#39;,
 &#34;Just hold it. That&#39;s what I do now. &#34;,
 &#34;Yeah, what&#39;s the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!&#34;,
 &#34;Yeah! Stan&#39;s a big old fat cissy!&#34;,
 &#34;Hey! Where do you think you&#39;re going?!&#34;,
 &#34;Oh no you don&#39;t! You&#39;ve gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! &#34;,
 &#39;Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo/&#39;,
 &#34;Hey Eric, I&#39;m just lookin&#39; at a video of bird eggs that I took.&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know, this bird nest is pretty neato.&#34;,
 &#39;My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.&#39;,
 &#39;You can see the momma bird fiy in.&#39;,
 &#39;We took all kinds of video with his drone.&#39;,
 &#39; You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot &#39;
 &#39;video and stuff.&#39;,
 &#34;It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever&#39;s controlling it. And it &#34;
 &#34;can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don&#39;t touch the &#34;
 &#39;propellers.&#39;,
 &#34;Are you crazy?! This is my dad&#39;s drone!&#34;,
 &#34;My dad said it&#39;s not for spying on people.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh he&#39;ll know. You can hear it take off.&#34;,
 &#34; No, Eric. I don&#39;t wanna d-&#34;,
 &#34;Comin&#39; dad! &#34;,
 &#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.&#34;,
 &#39;Of course not!&#39;,
 &#39;What?! You said nobody would know!&#39;,
 &#39;Be careful! The powerlines!&#39;,
 &#34;Okay, uh maybe that&#39;s enough. &#34;,
 &#39; Let me see!&#39;,
 &#39;Jeeeeezz!&#39;,
 &#39;What do I do?!&#39;,
 &#34; I don&#39;t know what to do!!&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, heh-hey dad.&#39;,
 &#34; Ah, oh no, Dad. I&#39;ve just been sleepin&#39;. Why do you ask?&#34;,
 &#39;I love you too, Dad. &#39;,
 &#39;What the heck are you doing?!&#39;,
 &#34;When did you put Craig&#39;s mom&#39;s bush on the Internet?!&#34;,
 &#34;You promised me we wouldn&#39;t get in trouble!&#34;,
 &#39;Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!&#39;,
 &#39;WHY?!&#39;,
 &#39;I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get &#39;
 &#39;out of hand!&#39;,
 &#39;Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!&#39;,
 &#39;Why would you turn &#34;Craig\&#39;s mom\&#39;s bush&#34; into a music video starring us?!&#39;,
 &#34;Why can&#39;t you leave it alone?! Why can&#39;t you just stop?!&#34;,
 &#39;Why???&#39;,
 &#39;That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.&#39;,
 &#39;Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Wull &#39;
 &#34;that&#39;s the last time I felt happy.&#34;,
 &#39;I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell &#39;
 &#34;Craig&#39;s mom we&#39;re sorry and that we&#39;ll-&#34;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t want anymore discussions, Eric! I don&#39;t want anymore excuses!&#34;,
 &#39;I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!&#34;,
 &#39;You do?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#34;NO! There is NO WAY I&#39;m gonna-&#34;,
 &#39;...Okay.&#39;,
 &#34;If this doesn&#39;t work, we&#39;re dead.&#34;,
 &#34;Craig&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t seem very happy.&#34;,
 &#34;No! Nono! I&#39;m sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now &#34;
 &#34;everyone&#39;s happy! Thanks for covering my ass!&#34;,
 &#39;Congratulations, Kyle.&#39;,
 &#34;Well, it&#39;s just 49 cents for the cheapest one. &#34;,

 &#34;WHOOAA! It&#39;s all so real! Uh this is amazing! It&#39;s like I&#39;m there!  I see &#34;

 &#39;What what what?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39; Oh Jesus! &#39;,
 &#34;Okay, I&#39;m back in your room!&#34;,

 &#34;Hey Eric! What&#39;d ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that &#34;
 &#39;we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? &#39;,
 &#39;You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn\&#39;t in school and I said &#34;Well, &#39;
 &#39;technically I was in school.&#34; Tee hee. Sotty guys, but Eric and I know a &#39;
 &#34;little something you don&#39;t. Not that it&#39;s anything that cool. Right Eric?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah. &#39;,

 &#34;Okay. It&#39;s so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I &#34;

 &#34; There&#39;s an old fat lady here! She&#39;s holding out money for me!&#34;,
 &#39;Okay, I got it!&#39;,
 &#39;Already? Oh no!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Eric, but there&#39;s just one thing I gotta do real quick. &#34;,
 &#34;Hello Dad! It&#39;s me, Butters!&#34;,
 &#39;This is for all the times I got grounded! &#39;,
 &#39;HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, &#39;

 &#39;Huh, that was incredible!&#39;,
 &#34;I feel amazing!  I&#39;m back outside now. I&#39;m a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh &#34;

 &#34; Who&#39;s the man now?! I&#39;m gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!&#34;,
 &#34;Whoa! Huh, I&#39;m in the car now&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m gonna beat her up and take her money!&#34;,
 &#39;Take that, you dumb hooker!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.&#34;,
 &#34;I can&#39;t  I can&#39;t breathe too good. Eric, I can&#39;t see. Are you still there? &#34;
 &#39;Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? &#39;
 &#39;What the hell is that?! AAAH!&#39;,
 &#34;I... I d-didnn&#39;t think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just &#34;
 &#39;in a virtual reality.&#39;,
 &#39;Aw nuts!&#39;,
 &#34;I wonder how long I&#39;m grounded for?&#34;,
 &#39;Ahhh!&#39;,
 &#39;Eric! Uh what are you doing here?&#39;,
 &#39;What?&#39;,
 &#39; Nuh uh!&#39;,
 &#39;WHAT?? &#39;,
 &#39; Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!&#39;,
 &#39;Ah how do you know that?!&#39;,

 &#39;...What? What do you mean?&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34;,
 &#39;Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh really? Oh, that&#39;s a relief.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh gosh!&#39;,
 &#39;OH GOSH!&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#34;Kyle, it&#39;s Butters. I&#39;ve been grounded!&#34;,
 &#34;No no, you don&#39;t understand. This time I&#39;ve been grounded for no good &#34;
 &#34;reason! I didn&#39;t do anyhing, Kyle!&#34;,
 &#34;I think there&#39;s somethin&#39; supernatural goin&#39; on. I asked my dad why I was &#34;
 &#39;being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! &#39;
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t make sense!&#34;,
 &#34;PLEASE! Just go to Cartman&#39;s house. I think the answer might be within the-&#34;,
 &#39;Ahhh! Wuhhhh! &#39;,
 &#34; I&#39;m troubled, I&#39;m troubled in mind. If Jesus don&#39;t help me I surely will &#34;
 &#39;die. &#39;,
 &#34; Huh. But...  you guys can&#39;t be here.&#34;,
 &#34;Because I&#39;m grounded. That means no visitors.&#34;,
 &#34;When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don&#39;t you guys remember?  &#34;
 &#34;We were all messin&#39; around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a &#34;
 &#39;little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and &#39;
 &#34;now I&#39;m grounded in real life.&#34;,
 &#39;YES.&#39;,
 &#39; AAaaghagh!&#39;,
 &#34;Huh I&#39;m sorry Dad!&#34;,
 &#39; Ahhh, huh?&#39;,
 &#34;You... you, you mean ih...  I&#39;m not grounded?&#34;,
 &#39;They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!&#39;,
 &#34; Fellas, I&#39;m not grounded anymore.&#34;,
 &#39;Oh no! Kenny!&#39;,
 &#34;But he&#39;s dying! &#34;,
 &#39;Dangit, I wish I knew people.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah.&#39;,
 &#39;Wow, the cops came?&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s a PewDiePie do?&#34;,
 &#34;Well it&#39;s a really great game. The characters are so rich.&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s true!&#34;,
 &#39;Heheyehah.&#39;,
 &#34;Hmmm, it&#39;s kind of gay.&#34;,
 &#34;I mean, havin&#39; it all rhyme &#39;n stuff, you know?&#34;,
 &#39;Well, gay is wholesome.&#39;,
 &#39;No, he got brainwashed by a cult.&#39;,
 &#39;What??&#39;,
 &#34; Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days&#39; suspension, for calling Heidi &#34;
 &#39;Turner &#34;clitty litter&#34;!&#39;,
 &#34;But the thing is, Eric isn&#39;t even fightin&#39; it. It&#39;s like he&#39;s all sad and &#34;
 &#39;scared.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting.&#39;,
 &#39;Well ohhh-kay! &#39;,
 &#39;What do we do now?&#39;,
 &#39; Oh no!&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m here, Eric.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes Eric.&#39;,
 &#34;Well they&#39;re fine. Everyone&#39;s just kind of keepin&#39; their mouths shut. It&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;kinda nice.  So the PC guys are leavin&#39; people alone. Well, except for...&#34;,
 &#34;Well, well now they&#39;ve made Kyle their main target.&#34;,
 &#39;Eric, what are you doing?&#39;,
 &#39;Oh, but I thought you agreed with them.&#39;,
 &#39;Well ohhh-kay!&#39;,
 &#34;Well they&#39;re all eatin&#39; together and praying. A-and they&#39;re puttin&#39; syrup on &#34;
 &#39;their Mac &amp; Cheese! &#39;,
 &#39;Uh uh.&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, sorry. I can&#39;t listen to another one either. &#34;,
 &#39;What made Mr. Garrison do that?&#39;,
 &#39;You really think Kyle would do that?&#39;,
 &#39;Lion King II?&#39;,
 &#39;No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!&#39;,
 &#34;She&#39;s not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!&#34;,
 &#39;Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something!  Jeez!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I don&#39;t want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!&#34;,
 &#34;No!  The one in the white shoes isn&#39;t that ugly.&#34;,
 &#34;Okay!  Hi, my name&#39;s Butters, what&#39;s yours.&#34;,
 &#34;Oh Charlotte, I&#39;ve never done this before. You think Scar&#39;s up there? Hew &#34;
 &#34;asn&#39;t my father, but he still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely &#34;
 &#34;begun. We&#39;ll run away together and ... and...?&#34;,
 &#39;Here you go.&#39;,
 &#39;What\&#39;s &#34;sore-y&#34;?&#39;,
 &#34;Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that&#39;s neato.  Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec.  &#34;
 &#39;What do you want?!&#39;,
 &#34;No, we saw a movie and now we&#39;re goin&#39; to the park.&#34;,
 &#34;If I&#39;m gonna be with this girl, I don&#39;t want her someday thinking it was all &#34;
 &#39;super-rushed!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s just some work-related stuff.&#34;,
 &#34; Oh boy, yes I&#39;d love to, here we go, oh God.&#34;,
 &#39;Well uh, well yes, sir.&#39;,
 &#34;W-wait, you don&#39;t wanna be here?&#34;,
 &#34;Wuh well, you know, &#39;cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff.&#34;,
 &#39;But- so- then, why did you leave?&#39;,
 &#39;Jeez, how bad can a president be?&#39;,
 &#34;You don&#39;t got to be sore-y. It&#39;s me who should be sore-y. I think everyone &#34;
 &#39;has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte.&#39;,
 &#34;I wasn&#39;t supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so &#34;
 &#34;our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don&#39;t even wanna be &#34;
 &#39;here.&#39;,
 &#34;There&#39;s really nowhere I&#39;d rather be.  If it&#39;s okay with you, well I&#39;d like &#34;
 &#39;to try a nice Slow Cosby instead.&#39;,
 &#39;So do we.&#39;,
 &#39;Charlotte!&#39;,
 &#39;Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby.&#39;,
 &#34;Wull do you think it&#39;s true? Do you think we&#39;re really bigoted country &#34;
 &#39;bumpkins?&#39;,
 &#34;Did you get &#39;em? Did you get &#39;em? Did you get &#39;em? Huh?&#34;,
 &#39;Whoooaaa. &#39;,
 &#39;How do you do it, Eric?&#39;,
 &#39;Jeeeeezzz. &#39;,
 &#34;Well aren&#39;t ya eatin&#39; lunch, Eric?&#34;,
 &#34;Wow! Well you&#39;re pretty important, Eric.&#34;,
 &#39; Oh, hey Eric.&#39;,
 &#34;Oh I&#39;m sorry, bud.&#34;,
 &#39;Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, &#39;
 &#39;you really started something.&#39;,
 &#39;Well these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of ,set the &#39;
 &#34;record straight and show them the way it&#39;s supposed to be done.&#34;,
 &#39;Do I gotta?&#39;,
 &#34;Wull if I get detention, uh I&#39;ll get grounded.&#34;,
 &#39; Eric, hold up.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. Yeah, right here.  I just finished this morning.&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. &#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.&#34;,
 &#34;But PC Principal, I really don&#39;t have time.&#34;,
 &#39;Yes sir...&#39;,
 &#34;Yech. Oh God that&#39;s terrible. Oh Jesus.&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa my God. Wugh.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeah!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;m sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;overloaded with all the new people.&#39;,
 &#34;Well I&#39;ve got Demi Lovato  to take care of now, and Lena Dumham just put a &#34;
 &#39;picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments.&#39;,
 &#39;Hokay, Eric. &#39;,
 &#39;Do I have to, sir?&#39;,
 &#34;PC Principal, ah I don&#39;t think you quite realize how much negative stuff I &#34;
 &#39;have to sift through.&#39;,
 &#39;Vin Diesel too??&#39;,
 &#39;GAAAHHH!&#39;,
 &#39;What? &#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know you, sir!&#34;,
 &#39; Well-ll the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! &#39;,
 &#34;The man! Themanthemanthemantheman!  The man he&#39;s gonna get me! He shadows me &#34;
 &#39;everywhere!  Do you see the man?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well he&#39;s gonna get me!&#34;,
 &#39; The world is darkness! The man is coming!&#39;,
 &#39;Aaaaa! Aaaaa!&#39;,
 &#39; Run for your lives, you little fucks, the man is coming! &#39;,
 &#34;The man is gonna get me if I don&#39;t stop!&#34;,
 &#39; YEEAAAAAGGHH! &#39;,
 &#39;Are you sure this is a good idea?&#39;,
 &#39;Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah!&#39;,
 &#39;Over this way! &#39;,
 &#39;Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?&#39;,
 &#39;OOF. Ow. Ahem.&#39;,
 &#34;We&#39;re just cool &#39;cause we&#39;re tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-.&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah?&#39;,
 &#39;Uh I thought you said it first.&#39;,
 &#39;Whooaa, cooool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!&#39;,
 &#39; PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! &#39;,
 &#39; Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for &#39;
 &#39;being an exemplary student.&#39;,
 &#34;What about Jimmy&#39;s?&#34;,
 &#39;What are you doing now?&#39;,
 &#39;Wow that looks fun! &#39;,
 &#39;Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?&#39;,
 &#39;So Clyde said to Token, &#34;Why don\&#39;t you open a bank account with your mouth &#39;
 &#39;so I can deposit my dick in it?&#34; &#39;,
 &#39;Well Token was all like-&#39;,
 &#34;We got distracted. We&#39;ve gotta get back to that computer! &#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;re tryin&#39; on shoes and eatin&#39; chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah.&#39;,
 &#34;Notin&#39;.&#34;,
 &#34;Wuh huh, that&#39;s a good point.&#34;,
 &#34; Yeahh, everybody&#39;s pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge &#34;
 &#34;and feelin&#39; really nervous.&#34;,
 &#39;I will, honey.&#39;,
 &#34;Heh,  Kyle&#39;s got a girlfriend?&#34;,
 &#39;Guns?&#39;,
 &#39;I already feel a lot safer.&#39;,
 &#39; Yeeeahh.&#39;,
 &#39;Haha! You guys see what skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he &#39;
 &#34;photoshopped a picture of Heidi Turner&#39;s mom with a dick in her mouth!&#34;,
 &#34; Look! There&#39;s Wendy&#39;s mom with a dick in her mouth too! &#34;,
 &#39;Eric! What happened!&#39;,
 &#34;They&#39;re talking about how they&#39;re gonna get us! Whattaya think? That&#39;s how &#34;
 &#39;the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to! Even if you &#39;
 &#34;didn&#39;t do nothin&#39;!&#34;,
 &#34;He&#39;s not gonna stop! He&#39;s lovin&#39; all lthis! He wants the girls to hurt us!&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s him, or us!&#34;,
 &#34; It&#39;s not the police we have to worry about, it&#39;s Eric. He&#39;s gonna get us.&#34;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. He&#39;s comin&#39;. He&#39;s comin&#39; to get us.&#34;,
 &#39; Eeeaaaahhhh!&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s been a rough few weeks, baby. The girls are still mad about bein&#39; &#34;
 &#34;trolled on the school message board, parents are all freakin&#39; out about the &#34;
 &#34;election, and, and I tell ya, you&#39;re glad not to be livin&#39; in this country &#34;
 &#39;right now.&#39;,
 &#34;But Charlotte, I love you! I need you! You can&#39;t break up with me!&#34;,
 &#34; Oh my God...  I can&#39;t believe they got to you. Why those slinky snakes in &#34;
 &#39;the grass!&#39;,
 &#39;Why you know who! The girls in my school! They all broke up with their &#39;
 &#39;boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!&#39;,
 &#34;So then it&#39;s true! You&#39;re all snakes in the grass! Every last one of ya!  &#34;
 &#39;Oh, Charlotte? Are you there? Honey?&#39;,
 &#34; Well why don&#39;t you shut the fuck up, Kyle! All I&#39;ve been hearin&#39; about the &#34;
 &#34;past few weeks is how this is our problem! How boys need to change! Well I&#39;m &#34;
 &#34;gettin&#39; pretty sick of it! Why everyone else seems to be able to be proud of &#34;
 &#34;who they are, but not us! And then we got Uncle Kyle here tallin&#39; us the &#34;
 &#39;girls are right!&#39;,
 &#39;This is a war on all of us! You wanna listen to Uncle Kyle, go on ahead!  &#39;
 &#34;Pretty soon they&#39;ll be lockin&#39; us all up! And don&#39;t think you&#39;re safe &#34;
 &#34;either, Tweek and Craig! Just &#39;cause you&#39;re gay doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;looked down upon for being boys! The world wants us all to feel shame just &#39;
 &#34;&#39;cause we were all born with wieners!&#34;,
 &#34;No! We tried doin&#39; it your way, Kyle! We tried doin&#39; what the girls wanted &#34;
 &#39;us to do, and where did it get us?!&#39;,
 &#34;Right! It turned us against one of our own, that&#39;s what it did! What &#34;
 &#34;happened to Eric Cartman was the girls&#39; fault, not ours!&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m done feelin&#39; guilt! I&#39;m a boy, dag-nabbit! And you know what? I&#39;m proud &#34;
 &#39;of my little wiener! Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need &#39;
 &#39;to decide. Are you with your kind, or are you with Uncle Kyle?!&#39;,
 &#39; We walk together in peace! We walk together in pride!  We are not going to &#39;
 &#39;feel ashamed for who we are! We are not going to feel guilt for the way we &#39;
 &#39;were born! Wieners out!&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t let anyone tell you you&#39;re somehow less because you&#39;re a boy! Don&#39;t &#34;
 &#39;let anyone tell you to not think with our wiener. As if your wiener is a bad &#39;
 &#39;thig! &#39;,
 &#39;What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame! No more doubt! No &#39;
 &#39;more bigotry! &#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are! You are either with us or &#34;
 &#34;against us!  It&#39;s really that simple!&#34;,
 &#39;Good for you, Uncle Kyle! &#39;,
 &#39; Any time, anywhere, skank!&#39;,
 &#39;Why? You afraid to fight me like a man?&#39;,
 &#39; Well okay. &#39;,
 &#39;The bouncy ball?&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s it! I am through with your stupid crap!  Every house I&#39;ve been to &#34;
 &#39;just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid!&#39;,
 &#39;I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid &#39;
 &#39;girls!&#39;,
 &#39;Whattayou want?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well I don&#39;t know, Eric.&#34;,
 &#34;NO! I&#39;m not doing anything for you! You&#39;re a traitor!&#34;,
 &#39;Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little &#39;
 &#34;girlfriend&#39;s ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!&#34;,
 &#39;Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be &#39;
 &#39;pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little &#39;
 &#34;girlfriend pullin&#39; your strings now!&#34;,
 &#39;Noh God, listen to you!  &#34;Mee don\&#39;t call her that Muhd I diddy die der.&#34; &#39;
 &#34;You&#39;ve changed, Eric! You&#39;ve raally changed! Now get the fuck out of my &#34;
 &#39;house! &#39;,
 &#34;Traitor!  Fuck you, Stan! You&#39;re a traitor! &#34;,
 &#39;How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! &#39;,
 &#39; What?&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I&#39;m tired of girls sayingn boys need to &#34;
 &#39;change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!&#39;,
 &#39; No.&#39;,
 &#39;The end? Of what?&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, Eric!&#39;,
 &#39;Well, I wanna get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a &#39;
 &#39;number!&#39;,
 &#34;No, you don&#39;t understand. I&#39;ve seen the light. I&#39;m a changed man! I thought &#34;
 &#34;boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... Shit&#39;s about to get a &#34;
 &#39;lot worse!&#39;,
 &#34;Lu lu lu, I&#39;ve got some apples. Lu lu lu, you&#39;ve got some too.&#34;,
 &#34;No, no, believe me, I&#39;m a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they&#39;ll &#34;
 &#34;be runnin&#39; the country soon, and they deserve total respect.&#34;,
 &#34;Well I don&#39;t think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember &#34;
 &#39;that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?&#39;,
 &#39;Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were &#39;
 &#34;women. I don&#39;t know why things changed. I don&#39;t know why people make such a &#34;
 &#39;big deal about women in comedy now. I mean, what about Carol Burnett. She &#39;
 &#39;was great!&#39;,
 &#34;Yeh-hah, well I swear I don&#39;t care how many times Amy Schumer talks about &#34;
 &#39;her vagina, I laugh every time.&#39;,
 &#34; That&#39;s already funny! &#34;,
 &#34;Hey, that&#39;s me too. Yippee!&#34;,
 &#34;Mr. Musk, wait!  Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I&#39;m not sure if &#34;
 &#34;you know our friend, Heidi. She&#39;s really smart, and really funny. &#34;,
 &#34; Heh, yeah!  Don&#39;t worry about Heidi, she&#39;s a hoot! &#34;,
 &#39; Hello. &#39;,
 &#34;Goin&#39; pee!&#34;,
 &#34;Well &#39;cause you keep tellin&#39; everyone she is.&#34;,
 &#39;Eric, Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! I know what &#39;
 &#39;girlfriends do. They make you feel the happiest you ever felt. Then they &#39;
 &#39;crawl up inside of you and... poop on your heart.&#39;,
 &#34;That&#39;s how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think &#34;
 &#34;they&#39;re the best thing in the world. And then they leave. Move on to the &#34;
 &#34;next thing. And you&#39;re left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.&#34;,
 &#39;Sure buddy. Sure.&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t feel bad about getting duped, Eric. It&#39;s happened to all of us.&#34;,
 &#34;The truth is, girls hate us, Eric. They&#39;re sick of our shit. And one day, &#34;
 &#39;they plan to make us obsolete and stick us underground where we just get &#39;
 &#34;milked for our semen. Boys&#39; only hope is to start over on Mars.&#34;,
 &#39;Yep.&#39;,
 &#34;Are you sure about what&#39;s goin&#39; to happen on Mars?&#34;,
 &#39;Because Eric knows the future.&#39;,
 &#39; Look underground. &#39;,
 &#39;I used to think women were fnnny too, but Eric talked me out of it.&#39;,
 &#34;Gee, I don&#39;t know what to tell you, buddy.&#34;,
 &#39;What?!&#39;,
 &#34;Well, I&#39;m at SpaceX. Where are you?&#34;,
 &#34;Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now we&#39;re trying &#34;
 &#39;to figure out what to do with it.&#39;,
 &#39;Well, like enough to get humanity to Mars.&#39;,
 &#39;Okay,  Alexa, add &#34;smelly tampon boogers&#34; to my shopping list.&#39;,
 &#39;What was?&#39;,
 &#34;How do you change someone who&#39;s mentally abusive?&#34;,
 &#39;I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.&#39;,
 &#39;So then why did you take her back?&#39;,
 &#34;Hey Craig, how come Tweek&#39;s not at school?&#34;,
 &#34; They can&#39;t do this! We made plans! &#34;,
 &#34; You can&#39;t take away a day off! We&#39;re just innocent children!&#34;,
 &#34;It ain&#39;t right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away &#34;
 &#34;your one day off in October like you&#39;re a piece of trash!&#34;,
 &#39;Whoa, I love that movie.&#39;,
 &#34;Dang it! There&#39;s nothing?&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it.&#34;,
 &#34;No Dad, I&#39;m not looking at boobies.  Waahahahahaha!&#34;,
 &#39;Oh. Uhn hey fellas.&#39;,
 &#39;Uuuuuuummm, nope. . The others wait a second or two before catching up&#39;,
 &#39; Yes, fellas?&#39;,

 &#39;to classss.&#39;,
 &#39; Who are you?! What do you want?!&#39;,
 &#34;Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in.  You&#39;re making a smart career choice, &#34;

 &#34;chaos, but to actually profit from it. You&#39;ll find the hours very reasonable &#34;
 &#34;and I&#39;m working on getting full health and dental for all employees.  Here&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;your company uniform. You see, what I&#39;ve done, Adam, is build a completely &#34;
 &#39;self-sustaining Chaos machine  - You look, you look fantastic - doing &#39;
 &#39;nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from &#39;
 &#39;Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake &#39;
 &#34;stories. And thusly we&#39;re growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have &#34;
 &#39;your attention please?  We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam &#39;
 &#39;Borque.  Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start &#39;

 &#39;fuck shit up! &#39;,
 &#39;Ah-tention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post &#39;
 &#34;that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let&#39;s hear it for Kelly!  &#34;
 &#34;Don&#39;t forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from &#34;
 &#39;pandemonium. &#39;,
 &#39;Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers.&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the 21st century, gentlemen! There&#39;s nothing illegal about what I&#39;m &#34;
 &#39;doing.&#39;,
 &#34;Actually, that IS illeggal. And besides, you can&#39;t do anything to me. &#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal &#34;
 &#39;protection from Marck Zuckerberg.&#39;,
 &#34;What&#39;s goin&#39; on? Hey everyne, keep working!&#34;,
 &#39;What are you talking about? &#39;,

 &#39;Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia &#39;

 &#34; Hey fellas!  Boy , that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh?  Well, he&#39;s &#34;
 &#34;really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it&#39;s good somebody&#39;s &#34;
 &#39;finally doing something about these godddamend drug dealers.  Well, see ya, &#39;
 &#39;fellas. &#39;,
 &#39;Drug dealer??&#39;,
 &#39;Haw Jeez.&#39;,
 &#39; Get out of the way, dude!&#39;,
 &#39;Insane in the brain&#39;,
 &#39;Hey, where are you all going?&#39;,
 &#39; Hey, where you been, Eric?&#39;,
 &#39;Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch &#39;
 &#39;around! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. &#39;
 &#39;Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, but what are we gonna do?&#39;,
 &#34;Yeah, we&#39;ve got to save Halloween. Don&#39;t you think so, Eric?&#34;,
 &#34;We&#39;ve got to do something to get rid of her!&#34;,
 &#39;I knew Eric would come up with a plan! &#39;,
 &#39;Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same &#39;
